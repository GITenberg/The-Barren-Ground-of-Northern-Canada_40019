<h3>AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL EDITION</h3>


<p>In many of the outlying districts of Canada
an idea is prevalent, fostered by former travellers,
that somewhere in London there exists a
benevolent society whose object is to send men
incapable of making any useful scientific observations
to the uttermost parts of the earth, in order
to indulge their taste for sport or travel.
Several times before I had fairly started for the
North, and again on my return, I was asked if I
had been sent out under the auspices of this society,
and, I am afraid, rather fell in the estimation
of the interviewers when I was obliged to
confess that my journey was only an ordinary
shooting expedition, such as one might make
to the Rocky Mountains or the interior of Africa,
and that no great political reformation depended
upon my report as to what I had seen.</p>

<p>In talking with officers of the Hudson's Bay
Company, many of whom had been stationed for
long periods in the Athabasca and Mackenzie
River districts, I had often heard of a strange
animal, a relic of an earlier age, that was still
to be found roaming the Barren Ground, the vast
desert that lies between Hudson's Bay, the eastern
ends of the three great lakes of the North,
and the Arctic Sea. This animal was the Musk-ox,
but my informants could tell me nothing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
personal experience, and all that was known on
the subject had been gathered from Indian report.
Once or twice some enthusiastic sportsman
had made the attempt to reach the land of
the Musk-ox, but had never succeeded in carrying
out his object; specimens had been secured by
the officers of the various Arctic expeditions, but
no one had ever seen much of these animals or of
the methods of hunting them employed by the
Northern Indians.</p>

<p>This, then, was the sole object of my journey;
to try and penetrate this unknown land, to see
the Musk-ox, and find out as much as I could
about their habits, and the habits of the Indians
who go in pursuit of them every year. But
the only white men who had succeeded in getting
far out into the Barren Ground were the early
explorers,&mdash;Hearne, Sir John Franklin, Sir
George Back, and Dr. Richardson, while long
afterwards Dr. Rae and Stewart and Anderson
went in search of the missing Franklin expedition.
With the exception of Hearne, who threw
in his lot with the Indians, these leaders were all
accompanied by the most capable men that could
be procured, and no expense was spared in order
to make success as certain as possible; yet in spite
of every precaution the story of Sir John Franklin's
first overland journey and the death of Hood
are among the saddest episodes in the history of
the Arctic exploration.</p>

<p>My best chance seemed to be to follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
Hearne's example, and trust to the local knowledge
of Indians to help me; and I think, as the
sequel showed, that I was right in not taking a
crew from Winnipeg. The Indians and half-breeds
of the Great Slave Lake, although very
hard to manage, are certainly well up in Barren
Ground travel; they are possessed of a thorough
knowledge of the movements of the various animals
at different seasons, and thus run less danger
of starvation than strangers, however proficient
the latter may be in driving dogs and
handling canoes.</p>

<p>In following out this plan I naturally passed
through a great deal of new country, and discovered,
as we white men say when we are pointed
out some geographical feature by an Indian who
has been familiar with it since childhood, many
lakes and small streams never before visited except
by the red man. I have attempted in a
rough map to mark the chains of lakes by which
we reached the Barren Ground, but their position
is only approximate, and perhaps not even that,
as I had no instruments with which to make correct
observations, and in any case should have
had little time to use them. Let no eminent geographer
waste his time in pointing out the inaccuracies
in this map; I admit all the errors before
he discovers them. All that I wish to show is
that these chains of lakes do exist and can be
used as convenient routes, doing away with the
often-tried method of forcing canoes up the swift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
and dangerous streams that fall into the Great
Slave Lake from the northern tableland.</p>

<p>The success of my expedition is to be attributed
entirely to the assistance which was given
me by the Hudson's Bay Company, and I take
this opportunity of thanking them for all the hospitality
that was shown to me throughout my
journey; I was never refused a single request
that I made, and, although a total stranger, was
treated with the greatest kindness by everybody,
from the Commissioner at Winnipeg to the engaged
servant in the Far North. My thanks are
especially due to Lord Anson, one of the directors
in London, to Messrs. Wrigley and William
Clark at Winnipeg, Mr. Roderick MacFarlane,
lately of Stuart's Lake, British Columbia, a well-known
northern explorer who put me in the way
of making a fair start, Dr. Mackay of Athabasca,
Mr. Camsell of Mackenzie River, Mr. Ewen Macdonald
of Peace River, and most of all to Mr.
Mackinlay of Fort Resolution on the Great Slave
Lake, who was my companion during a long summer
journey in the Barren Ground.</p>

<p>My only excuse for publishing this account of
my travels is that the subject is a reasonably new
one, and deals with a branch of sport that has
never been described. I have spared the reader
statistics, and I have kept my story as short as
possible. I hope that in return anyone who may
be interested in these pages will spare his comments
on faulty style, and the various errors into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
which a man who has spent much time among the
big game is sure to fall when he is rash enough to
lay down his rifle and take up the pen.</p>

<p>I have also cut out the chapter with which
these books usually begin,&mdash;a description of the
monotonous voyage by Atlantic steamer and Canadian
Pacific Railway, and start at once from
Calgary, a thriving cattle-town close under the
eastern foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<h1>THE<br />
BARREN GROUND<br />

NORTHERN CANADA<br /><br /></h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p>In the middle of June, 1889, I left Calgary for
a drive of two hundred miles to Edmonton, the
real starting-point for the great northern country
controlled by the Hudson's Bay Company, and,
with the exception of their scattered trading-posts,
and an occasional Protestant or Roman
Catholic Mission, entirely given up to what it
was evidently intended for, a hunting-ground for
the Indian.</p>

<p>My conveyance was a light buckboard, containing
my whole outfit, which was as small as possible,
consisting almost entirely of ammunition
for a 12-bore Paradox and a 50-95 Winchester
Express, besides a pair of large blankets and a
little necessary clothing.</p>

<p>Forest fires were raging in the Rocky Mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
close at hand, and the thick smoke obscuring
the sun, the heat was not nearly so fierce as
usual at this time of the year; the road was good
for a prairie road, and comfortable stopping-places
each night made the journey quite easy.
About sixty miles out the country loses the appearance
of what is known among cattlemen as
the bald-headed prairie, and is dotted with clumps
of poplar, and occasionally pines; half way to
Edmonton the road crosses the broad stream of
the Red Deer, and passes through the most attractive
country that I have seen in the north-west
territories. It is being rapidly settled, and, with
the convenience of a railway now building between
Calgary and Edmonton, cannot fail to be
an important farming and stock-raising district
within a few years.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fifth day I reached Edmonton,
a pleasant little town scattered along
the far bank of the North Saskatchewan, and
historical in the annals of the Hudson's Bay Company,
by whom it was established as a fur trading-post
many years ago; it is fated shortly to
lose its individuality in the stream of advancing
civilization, and will probably develop into an
ordinary prairie-town of some importance.</p>

</a><span class="caption"><br />Old Hudson Bay Post at Edmonton</span>
</div>

<p>Finding that I had no time to spare if I wished
to catch the steamer down the Athabasca river, I
left again the same evening, after buying a small
supply of flour and bacon. I changed the buckboard
for a wagon, having for driver a French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
half-breed who had spent his early life on the
prairie in buffalo-hunting, but, on the extinction
of the game, had been earning a living by freighting
for the Hudson's Bay Company, and farming
on a small scale. He was a much pleasanter
companion than the smartly dressed young man,
"come of good folks in the East," who had been
my driver from Calgary, and many an interesting
tale he told me on our three-days' journey to the
banks of the Athabasca; tales of the good old
times when the buffalo were thick, and the Crees
waged perpetual war against the Blackfeet, and
whisky formed the staple article of trade for the
Indian's fur. At the present day the Prohibition
Act orders that even the white men of the north-west
territories must be temperate, thereby causing
whisky to be dear and bad, but plentiful
withal, and it is surprising how such a law exists
in a country where nine men out of ten not only
want to drink, but do drink in open defiance of
the commands of a motherly Government.</p>

<p>A fair road some hundred miles in length has
been made by the Hudson's Bay Company
through a rolling sandy country, crossing several
large streams and passing through a good deal
of thick pine timber where some heavy chopping
must have been necessary. The flies bothered us
greatly; the large bulldogs, looking like a cross
between a bee and a blue-bottle, drove the horses
almost to madness, and after our mid-day halt it
was no easy matter to put the harness on; fortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
we had netting, or the poor beasts would
have fared much worse: as it was the blood was
streaming from their flanks during the heat of
the day. The mosquitos appeared towards evening,
but as the nights were usually chilly they
only annoyed us for a few hours. There were no
houses along the road, but plenty of firewood
and feed for the horses; we had a good camp
every night, sleeping in the open air, starting very
early and resting long in the middle of the day.</p>

<p>Two days took us over the divide between the
Saskatchewan and Athabasca rivers, and now the
water in the little streams that we crossed eventually
reached the sea far away in the frozen Arctic
Ocean at the mouth of the great Mackenzie.
Early on the fourth day we came in sight of the
Athabasca running between high pine-clad banks,
and, dropping down a steep hill, found the Company's
steamer loading up with freight for the
far north. This spot is known as the Athabasca
landing, and consists of a large depot for goods,
trading-store, and several workmen's houses,
while the house of the officer in charge stands on
the hillside a little way back from the river.
From the landing there is water communication
down stream, broken of course by portages, to
the Arctic sea, while the Lesser Slave Lake lies
within a few days' travel up stream, from the
north end of which a road seventy-five miles in
length has been cut to the bank of Peace River. I
spent a pleasant enough day loafing about, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Wood, who was in charge, showing me great
kindness and giving me much useful information
about my route, and at twelve o'clock the following
day we started down stream. The only other
passengers were a Mr. Flett and his wife and
daughter, who were on their way to take charge
of Fort Smith during the coming winter. Mr.
Flett was just returning from a visit to his native
country, the Orkney Islands, after an absence of
forty-four years in the service of the Company,
all of which time was spent in the wildest part
of the North. He was full of the wonderful
changes that had taken place since he was a boy,
but finding himself completely lost in civilization,
had hurried back to the land of snow. Unfortunately
Mrs. Flett had been unable to stand the
climate of the old country, and was quite broken
down in her health. I was sorry to hear during
the winter that she died a few days after we left
her at Fort Chipeweyan.</p>

<p>Owing to the very light snowfall in the mountains
in the winter of 1888-89, the water in the
river was unusually low, and, as we expected, on
the third day the steamer, a large light-draught
stern-wheeler, after striking several times on shallow
bars, had to abandon the attempt to reach the
Grand Rapids. We accordingly tied up to the
bank, and, sending a skiff down to take the news,
awaited the arrival of boats from below to take
our cargo. For ten days we lay at the junction of
Pelican River, a small stream coming in on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
north side of the Athabasca. There was absolutely
nothing to do; the low gravelly banks on
each side were fringed with thick willows backed
by a narrow belt of poplars, and behind these the
gloomy pine woods, with here and there a solitary
birch, stretched away in an unbroken mass as far
as the eye could see. The forest was alive with
mosquitos, although owing to the low water in
the river they were said to be much less numerous
than usual; they were sufficiently thick however
to make any exploration in the woods a misery.
Fishing we tried without much result, and everybody
was pleased when at last Mr. Scott Simpson,
who was in charge of the river transport that
summer, arrived with two boats. The steamer's
cargo was unloaded, partly into the boats and
partly on to the bank, and early in the morning
she started back for the landing while we proceeded
on our journey down stream.</p>

<p>These inland boats, as they are termed, are extraordinary
specimens of marine architecture,
long open craft, classified according to shape as
York boats, sturgeon-heads, and scows, capable of
carrying a load of ten tons, manned by a crew
of eight oars and a steersman, rowed down
stream and tracked up, running rapids and bumping
on rocks. Planks, nails, and pitch are always
kept ready to effect repairs, and are in frequent
demand. The crews are generally half-breeds
from the Lesser Slave Lake and Lake La
Biche, both of which pour their waters into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Athabasca; but there are also volunteers from
all parts of the North, as the wages are good and
the work is suited to the half-breed's character,
besides the certainty of receiving rations every
day, which is a great attraction in a land of scarcity.
Sometimes crews of Locheaux Indians are
sent up from the Mackenzie, and have the reputation
of being the best workers; they certainly
seemed to me to be less given to rebellion and
more easily managed than the half-breeds. The
boats are steered with a huge sweep passed
through a ring in the stern post, and great responsibility
rests on the steersman, who at times
requires all his skill and strength to throw the
heavily-laden boat clear of a rock in a boiling
rapid.</p>

</a><span class="caption"><br />The Hudson Bay Fort at Edmonton</span>
</div>

<p>In three days, without accident, we reached
the island at the head of the Grand Rapids, just
in time to rescue a Company's clerk named Mackay
from a very unenviable position. He had
come up with the boat-brigade from Fort MacMurray,
and, provisions running short, had travelled
overland accompanied by a half-breed to
meet the steamer from which they expected to get
supplies to take down to the crews. On reaching
the island they were unable to attract the attention
of the man left in charge of the freight lying
there, so they walked a couple of miles up the
north bank and built a raft on which to cross the
river. They thought they would be able to pole
the raft, but the water proved too deep, and being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
unable to get steerage way on her, they soon broke
their unmanageable vessel to pieces against a rock.
It was now a case of swimming in a strong current
that was forcing them over the big rapid
where certain death awaited them; the half-breed
succeeded in fetching the island, but Mackay, seeing
he was being swept over the fall, swam to a
rock and managed to climb on to it. The half-breed
found the sole inhabitant of the island in his
cabin, but there was no boat in which to go to
the rescue, and if there had been it was no easy
matter for two men to lower it down, without
all going over the rapid. They were engaged in
building a raft to make the attempt when they
saw our brigade coming down the river. By the
aid of a long line and plenty of hands the smallest
boat was lowered down to the rocks, and what
might have been a very serious accident was luckily
averted. Mackay was much chilled by sitting
on the rocks for several hours in wet clothes after
two days without eating; but, when he had had a
good meal he was none the worse for his rough
experience, and, as is always the case when the
danger is past, had plenty of chaff to put up with.</p>

<p>The channel on the south side of the island can
be used for dropping a light boat down with a
line, but all cargo has to be portaged; the north
channel is quite impracticable for navigation, having
a heavy overfall with an immense body of
broken water. The whole river-bed above the
island is covered with round boulders of soft
sandstone, many above water, which make the approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to the landing difficult. The north bank
is a sand-bluff with many similar boulders protruding
from the steep cliff, the south bank lower
and timbered close to the water's edge. Many
perfect specimens of petrifaction are to be seen
on the island and along the river-banks.</p>

<p>The portage is the whole length of the island,
about one thousand yards, and a rough tramway
has been built to save the labour of carrying cargoes
such a distance on men's backs; this tramway
is a splendid plaything for the crews, and
they spend hours in running the trolley down the
hill and poling it up on the principle of a canoe
ascending a rapid. Here we passed two weeks
in waiting for the boats from below to take the
whole of the steamer's load, which during this
time was brought down by the same boats that we
had used. The time slipped away quickly, though
we did nothing but smoke and yarn, and towards
the end of July the brigade turned up, bringing
the first consignment of furs and the news from
the North. We were soon off on our hundred-and-fifty-miles'
run to Fort MacMurray, and the
travelling was now exciting enough, a succession
of rapids making hard work for the men, as several
had to be run with half loads and the boats
tracked up for the other half, and at a small cascade
everything had to be portaged while the
boats were dropped over with a line.</p>

<p>The worst rapid goes by the name of the Boiler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Rapid, from the fact of the boiler for the steamer
<i>Wrigley</i> which plies on Mackenzie River having
been lost here through the breaking of a boat.
Here the channel has a bad turn in the strong
water, and neat steering is required to clear two
reefs of rocks which lie in an awkward position
in the middle of the stream. Sometimes there
were long stretches of quiet water between the
rapids, and the boats drifted with the current
while the men smoked or slept; occasionally some
one would strike up a snatch from one of the old
French-Canadian <i>chansons</i>, which seem to be
dropping out of fashion entirely since the steamers
have to such a large extent done away with
the old style of boating. Four, five, and on long
days sometimes six times we put ashore to eat;
a wonderful amount of flour, bacon, and tea being
consumed by the fifty men composing the brigade.
Considering the distance from which the
provisions are brought, the inability of this part
of the country to supply any of the necessaries of
life, and the importance of forwarding trading-goods
to the northern districts before the short
summer closes, it is not surprising that there
should be at times a scarcity. On the present occasion,
however, there was no stint, and fine
weather made the trip delightful. At night the
boats were run ashore, and each crew lighting
their own fire, the encampment presented a most
picturesque appearance, the gaudy belts and head-gear
of the swarthy crews as they moved in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
firelight showing in strong contrast to the dark
background of tall pine trees. We generally chose
as exposed a place as possible for the camp, to get
the benefit of any wind there might be to blow
away the mosquitos, which were bad in this part
of the river. I had the post of honour in the
leading boat steered by the guide of the brigade,
a Swampy Indian from the Red-River country
who had spent many years in voyaging for the
Hudson's Bay Company. In former days the
guide was absolute dictator and had full control
over all the boats, but nowadays discipline is slack
and he seems to have little authority.</p>

<p>It was a pretty sight to see the long string of
boats leaping the rapids behind us, the bowsman
standing up and pointing the course to the steersman,
while the rowers plied their utmost and
broke out into the wild shouts that can never be
suppressed in moments of excitement. The Cree
language forms the medium of conversation, although
many of the half-breeds talk fluently in
Red-River French; English is little spoken in any
part of the North that I visited.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the fourth day we arrived
at Fort MacMurray, a small post of little importance,
standing at the junction of the Athabasca
and the Clearwater River, a large stream coming
in from the southward, and until the completion
of the Canadian Pacific Railway to Calgary the
main route to the North. The outfits sent from
Winnipeg used to reach the waters falling into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the Arctic Sea far up the Clearwater at the northern
end of what was known as the Long Portage,
but the present route is much simpler, as there
is no up-stream work with loaded boats. After
leaving Fort MacMurray the old course is maintained,
following down stream the main artery of
the northern watershed.</p>

<p>The stern-wheel steamer <i>Grahame</i> was waiting
for us in the mouth of the Clearwater, with Dr.
Mackay, the Hudson's Bay Company's officer in
charge of the Athabasca district of which MacMurray
is the most southerly post. It extends to
the north as far as Fort Resolution on the Great
Slave Lake, and also takes in Fort Chipeweyan,
the head-post of the district, situated at the west
end of the Athabasca Lake, Fond du Lac at the
east end of the same sheet of water, Vermillion
and Little Red River on the Lower Peace River,
and Fort Smith at the foot of the rapids on the
Slave River. It is no sinecure for the man that
has to keep this vast extent of country supplied
with everything necessary for the existence of
the Indians, making the best bargain he can for
the products of their hunts, and endeavouring to
please the Chipeweyans in the woods and the
shareholders of the Company in England at the
same time.</p>

<p>The cargo was put on board the steamer in the
evening, and in the early morning we started
once more for the North. The water was still
exceedingly low, but not so much so as to be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
impediment to navigation, as the stream increases
in size after the junction of the Clearwater, and
beyond scraping once or twice on sand-bars, our
progress was uninterrupted. About twenty miles
below MacMurray we stopped to take on wood
and pitch from the natural tar deposits which
are just beginning to attract a little attention in
Eastern Canada, and the geologists, about to be
sent from Ottawa to examine into the resources
of this part of the country, will doubtless make a
thorough investigation of the amount and quality
of the deposit.</p>

<p>The whole of that day we steamed through a
wilderness of pine timber presenting exactly the
same appearance as in the upper reaches of the
river, but on the following morning the banks became
low and swampy, the stream sluggish and
divided into various branches, and a few miles of
intricate navigation brought us out on to the
Athabasca Lake. Across on the north shore we
could make out the white houses and church of
Fort Chipeweyan, and after a couple of hours'
steaming, with smooth water, we were alongside
the rather rough apology for a landing-place.</p>

<p>Fort Chipeweyan was established in the early
days of fur-trading, and a hundred years ago was
the starting-point of Sir Alexander Mackenzie's
voyage of discovery that resulted in the exploration
and naming of the immense stream discharging
from the Great Slave Lake. It was the scene
of many stirring events during the rivalry of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
North-West and the Hudson's Bay Companies,
and since their amalgamation has always been an
important trading-post. At the present day it
consists of a long row of white painted log-houses
occupied chiefly by the Company's servants; at
the southern end are the officers' quarters in close
proximity to the large trading and provision
stores; at the north end stand the Protestant
church and Mission buildings, and farther along
the lake is the Roman Catholic establishment.
The numerous houses form quite an imposing
sight in contrast to the surrounding desolation.
The settlement is almost at the west end of the
Athabasca Lake which stretches away some two
hundred and fifty miles to the eastward, with
Fond du Lac, a small outpost, at the far end.</p>

<p>Since the steamers have been running Chipeweyan
has been partly supplied with the provisions
of civilization, but is still chiefly dependent
on its fisheries for food, and great pains are
taken in the autumn to store as many whitefish as
possible. At the commencement of cold weather
every available net is working and the fish are
hung on stages to freeze; a large number are
spoilt for eating if the weather turns warm during
hanging-time, but they are always available
for the dogs. Trout-lines are worked all the winter,
and if the supply seems to be running short,
nets are also set under the ice, but usually without
such good results as at the Fall fishery. Caribou
from the Barren Ground sometimes wander near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Fond du Lac, and whenever this occurs the fort is
kept well supplied by the Indians, but an occasional
moose affords as a rule the only chance of
fresh meat. Many geese and ducks are killed
and salted during the spring and autumn migration
of wild-fowl, which come to the Athabasca
Lake at these periods in vast numbers. Chipeweyan
has a large population for the part of the
world in which it is situated, and as there is a proportionate
consumption of food no chance of laying
in a stock is missed. The lake still affords
an excellent field for exploration, as beyond the
main route to the east end and some of the nearer
fisheries very little is known to the Whites, and
the country in every direction from Fond du Lac
is mapped chiefly on information derived from
Indians. It is unlikely that there are any startling
discoveries to be made, as the general character
of the country seems to be the same as that of the
district lying to the north and east of the Great
Slave Lake, developing gradually into the Barren
Ground; but there must be many geographical
features in the form of streams and lakes to be
noticed, which might amply repay the trouble of
a summer's exploration. All supplies can easily
be taken by water-carriage as far as the east end
of the lake, though of course the well-known difficulty
of transporting provisions into the Barren
Ground would commence as soon as the main lake
was left.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>After a stay of a few hours at the Fort, we
started again in the <i>Grahame</i> on our voyage to
the head of the rapids at Fort Smith, a distance
of perhaps a hundred miles, and almost immediately
passed into the main stream leaving the
lake, and until the junction of the Peace bearing
the name of the Rocky River. During the high
water in summer part of the water of the Peace
finds its way into the Athabasca Lake by a passage
known as the Quatres Fourches, but as the
floods subside a slight current sets in the opposite
direction; the lake thus has another outlet into
the Peace, which eventually joins the Rocky River
about thirty miles below; the combined stream is
then called the Slave River till it debouches into
the Great Slave Lake, on leaving which it becomes
the Mackenzie.</p>

<p>A distinct alteration in the appearance of the
country is visible on leaving Fort Chipeweyan.
The red granite rock shows up and the pine timber
is smaller and more scattered, burnt in many
places, and mixed with a thick growth of willows
and berry-producing bushes; the scenery from the
river is monotonous and without landmarks, although
a wider view can be obtained than in running
down the Athabasca, where the big pine-trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
prevent all chance of seeing far in any direction.
The current is of no great velocity with the
exception of two small rapids formed by the contraction
of the channel; both are navigable, although
at certain stages of water it is necessary
to put out a rope to assist the steamer in mounting
the more formidable of the two. We had a very
merry passage down, Dr. Mackay and several of
the officers of his district accompanying us, and
in good time on the second day we tied up to the
bank on the west side of the river, just at the
head of the rapids.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

</a><span class="caption"><br />The Grahame Towing Freight-scows on Lake Athabasca</span>
</div>

<p>I must take this opportunity of congratulating
the Hudson's Bay Company on the efficient manner
in which their steamers are managed. Considering
the utter incapacity of the Indian and
half-breed crews when they first come on board,
great praise is due to the captains and engineers
for their success in overcoming obstacles in navigation
and carrying on the Company's business
in a country so remote from civilization. Everything
is done in a quiet and orderly way, and a
very noticeable feature is the total absence of the
swearing and profanity so essential to the well-being
of a river-steamer in other parts of the
American continent.</p>

<p>The next day the work of portaging began, as
the whole cargo had to be transported sixteen
miles to the lower end of the rapids. In former
days the goods were taken down by water, necessitating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
many portages and great delay; but
within the last few years a road has been cut
through the woods on the west side of the river,
and the portage is made with Red-River carts
drawn by oxen. Twenty carts are in use, starting
loaded and returning light, on alternate days.
The road is fair in a dry summer, but full of
mud-holes in bad weather, and celebrated as the
worst place for mosquitos in all the North.</p>

<p>While this was going on we amused ourselves
with duck-shooting on some lakes and muskegs
a few miles back from the landing, and our bag
was always a welcome addition to the table, as
no other kind of fresh meat was to be had. Big
game is very scarce along the main route, and
though there are still a few moose and bear it is
rarely that an animal is seen close to the banks
of the river. As soon as the cargo was all over
we went across to Fort Smith, standing just below
the rapids, to await the arrival of the Mackenzie
River steamboat which was expected at
any time. Dr. Mackay took me down the old
boat-route in a canoe, and I had a good opportunity
of seeing what labour and risk there must
have been with heavily-laden boats; we made
some fifteen portages in all, which occupied a long
afternoon, with only a light canoe. A large colony
of pelicans have taken possession of some
islands among the rapids, and rear their young
without fear of molestation.</p>

<p>Fort Smith, in spite of its fine situation on an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
open flat high above the river, is the most disreputable
establishment I came across in the
North, and the contrast was more striking as most
of the forts are kept rather smartly. Several
half-breeds have settled close round, and a large
band of Indians, known as the Caribou-Eaters,
whose hunting-ground lies between the two big
lakes, get their supplies from here. Within a
short distance is Salt River, which produces all
the salt consumed in the country, and saves the
expense of importing this necessary article.</p>

<p>On August 13th, after several days' waiting,
the steamer <i>Wrigley</i> arrived, bringing up the
Mackenzie River furs and several of the officers
from that district. Among her passengers was a
French half-breed, King Beaulieu, who afterwards
became my guide to the Barren Ground.
He agreed to go in this capacity at a consultation
held in Dr. Mackay's presence, swearing eternal
fidelity and promising to do everything in his
power to ensure the success of the expedition.
Nobody could give him a very good character,
but as he was known as a pushing fellow and first-rate
traveller, besides having made a successful
musk-ox hunt in the previous year, I concluded
that my best chance lay in going with him. Certainly,
with all his faults, I must say that he was
thoroughly expert in all the arts of travel with
canoes or dog-sleighs, quick in emergencies, and
far more courageous than most of the half-breeds
of the Great Slave Lake. When I was alone with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
him I found him easy enough to manage; but his
three sons, who accompanied us, are the biggest
scoundrels I ever had to travel with, and as they
seem to demoralize the old man when they are
together, the united family is a bad combination.</p>

<p>Two more days were passed in loading the
<i>Wrigley</i>, and in discussion among the officers
from the two districts, who only meet on this
occasion, and have to make the most of the short
stay to go over the news of the last year and prospects
for the next. Mr. Camsell, who is in charge
of Mackenzie River district, was on board, and,
although I never actually went within his dominions,
was exceedingly kind in giving me supplies
from his own outfit, and in doing everything he
could do to help me during the year that I spent
in the neighbourhood of the Great Slave Lake.</p>

<p>The <i>Wrigley</i>, having the rough crossing of the
lake to make, is a very different style of boat to
the stern-wheelers above, which do all their work
in smooth water. She is a screw-boat, drawing
seven feet when loaded; and it gives an idea of
the great size of the Mackenzie when I mention
that a vessel with this draught of water has a
clear run of thirteen hundred miles from Fort
Smith to Peel's River, a tributary joining the
main stream from the west a short distance above
its mouth. She has never, I believe, steamed
into the Arctic Sea, partly on account of the
channel being unknown, and partly owing to the
shortness of the season, which necessitates her being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>constantly at work to supply the forts before
the closing of navigation.</p>

<p>After leaving Fort Smith and passing the
mouth of Salt River the Slave River widens considerably,
and, with a slight current running between
low banks and numerous islands, follows
a more circuitous course than in its upper reaches.
The steamer's course covers a distance of one
hundred and eighty miles to the Great Slave Lake,
but, in travelling with canoes or dogs, a number
of portages are made to cut off bends of the
river, and about one-third of the distance is
saved.</p>

<p>The granite formation is quickly lost sight of
from the water. The sandy banks are covered
with a dense growth of willows backed by the
pine forest; a gloomy uninviting stretch of country,
to which the tall dead trees charred by former
fires give a peculiar air of desolation. The soft
nature of the sand, and the fact that much of
the bank has fallen in through the action of the
ice breaking up in the spring, render tracking
difficult on this part of the river; the fallen timber
leaning over it at all angles, and making it
impossible to pass the line. The sluggish nature
of the current, however, compensates for this, as
its strength can always be overcome by oars or
paddles in the bad places. Early on the second
day we steamed through the low delta lands at the
mouth of the river, and, passing cautiously among
the sandy battures lying far off shore, arrived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
heavy rain and strong westerly wind at Fort
Resolution, situated about ten miles to the westward
of the river's mouth. Mr. Mackinlay, who
is in charge of the fort, was away; but, as the
steamer was delayed for a couple of days by the
storm that was blowing, Mr. Camsell gave me
very valuable assistance in making preparation for
my voyage.</p>

<p>The resources of the fort were at the lowest;
no supplies had yet arrived from outside, and the
people were entirely dependent on their nets for
food: as is usually the case at this time of year,
fish were scarce and hard times prevalent. A
boat had been fitted out to be sent to the east end
of the lake to trade for meat with the Indians
hunting there; but after waiting a long time for
the steamer, to obtain the ammunition necessary
for trading, she was blown ashore and broken
up on the night of our arrival. I had intended
to take a passage by this boat; but as a party of
men had to be sent to Fort Smith to bring down
another one, and I was anxious to get among the
game with as little delay as possible, I determined
to make the journey as well as I could with canoes.</p>

<p>It was now that I made the acquaintance of
King Beaulieu's sons, François, José, and Paul,
each of them married and father of such a big
family that it makes one tremble for the future
of the Great Slave Lake country when the next
generation has grown up. The original Beaulieu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
seems to have been a French half-breed brought
in by the Hudson's Bay Company among the early
<i>voyageurs</i> from Red River. He settled at Salt
River, where buffalo were numerous at the time,
and by an indefinite number of wives raised a
large family which is threatening gradually to inundate
the North. King's father appears to have
been a fighting man, and great stories of his
bravery and prowess are told by his sons and
grandsons; but his name only appears in the
Company's records in connection with various
deeds of violence not much to his credit.</p>

<p>All King's family were hanging about the fort
in a state of semi-starvation, and I was glad when
we eventually started well on in the afternoon
of August 19th, with the hope of reaching first
some good fishing-ground to supply them with
food for immediate want, and afterwards the
country of the caribou in the woods to the north
of the lake, while beyond that again was the prospect
of finding the musk-ox far out in the Barren
Ground.</p>

<p>In character a Beaulieu is a mixture of a very
simple child and a German Jew; all the lack of
reason of the one combined with the greed of the
other, and a sort of low cunning more like that
of an animal than a human being. He is not
a nice man to travel with, as he always keeps
a longing eye on his master's possessions, even
though he is fully as well-equipped himself, and is
untrustworthy if you leave anything in his charge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
To your face he is fairspoken and humble enough,
and to hear him talk you would think he had a
certain amount of regard for you; but out of
sight the promises are forgotten, and he is devising
some scheme to annoy you and get something
out of you. The only way to treat him is as you
would treat a dog; if you are kind to him he
takes it as a sign that you are afraid of him, and
acts accordingly. With the exception of King
there is no fear of violence; but his passion is
at times so uncontrollable that he is capable of
anything. It is needless to relate all the bother
I had with these people, and I shall content myself
with saying that the whole time I was with
them the camp was the scene of one continuous
wrangle; sometimes they would quarrel with me
and sometimes among themselves, but we never
did anything without having a row.</p>

<p>As far as Fort Resolution the travelling had
been almost as easy, although there were many
delays, as in civilization; but directly you branch
from the Company's main route you are thrown
entirely on your own resources, and, owing to the
impossibility of carrying enough provision for a
prolonged journey in the Barren Ground, the
rifle and net are the only means of obtaining food.
This is a point to be well considered before undertaking
a trip to the country of the musk-ox, as,
however well you may be supplied at starting, you
are sure to experience some hard times before
your object is accomplished.</p>

<p>My only provisions consisted of a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
sacks of flour and about fifty pounds of bacon,
and I might as well have started with none at all.
My companions had all the improvidence of the
Indian nature, and hated the idea of keeping anything
for hard times. There was such a constant
begging, not without a certain excuse from hunger,
to be allowed to eat flour and bacon, that I
was really rather glad when it was all gone,
which was actually the case before we left the
Great Slave Lake. We had a good supply of tea
and tobacco, though it proved after all insufficient,
plenty of ammunition for the three Winchester
rifles, and powder, shot, and ball for the muzzle-loading
weapons of the party; we had also nets
and a few hooks and lines, matches, needles, and
awls to be used in the manufacture of moccasins
and the deer-skin clothes so essential for winter
travel; knives of various shapes and sizes, scrapers
for dressing skins, and a small stock of the
duffel imported by the Company for lining mittens
and wrapping up the feet during the intense
cold that we were sure to experience during the
trip.</p>

<p>Our fleet numbered three large birch-bark canoes,
crowded with men, women, and children,
amounting in all to over twenty souls, or, to be
more practical, mouths. Besides these there were
fifteen gaunt and hungry dogs, which had been
spending their short summer's rest in starving as
a preparation for the hard work and harder blows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
which were in store for them in the coming winter.</p>

<p>I was of course the only white man in the party,
and whatever conversation I held with the three
or four half-breeds that I could understand was
carried on in the French patois of the North.
Among themselves they used the Montaignais
dialect of the Chipeweyan language, which is
spoken with variations to the northward of the
Cree-speaking belt, till its place is taken by the
Slavi and Locheaux language of the Mackenzie
River; in a couple of months I had picked up
enough Montaignais to be able to mix it with
French and make myself fairly well understood.</p>

<p>Four deerskin lodges made our encampment. I
lived with King, as his camp was always the quietest;
in the other lodges there was a continual
screaming of children, or yelping of hungry dogs
as they felt the cruel blow of axe or paddle, which
was the sure result of approaching the savoury-smelling
kettle too close. We camped the first
night in the delta of the Slave, or, as it is more
usually called, the Big River. I distributed a little
ammunition, and we killed enough ducks to provide
the whole party with a night's provision.
The next day a gale of wind was blowing from
the lake, and, after following winding muddy
channels all the morning, we were obliged to camp
again on a point of willows beyond which we
should have been exposed to the full violence of
the storm, and our overloaded canoes would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
had no chance of living in the heavy sea. Here
we remained two days, still within twenty miles
of the fort. Wild-fowl were numerous, but the
great autumn migration had not yet set in, and
all the birds that we found had been bred in the
muskegs that surrounded us on all sides; they
were mostly mallard, widgeon, teal, shoveller,
and pintail, the latter being particularly plentiful.
Musk-rats swam in all the little creeks and lakes,
and, as they are esteemed as an article of food,
and their skins are of a trifling value, we killed
a great many.</p>

</a><span class="caption"><br />Patching a Birch-bark on the Slave River</span>
</div>

<p>On the third day we paddled along the shore
of the lake against a strong head-wind, passing
the Isle de Pierre, one of the best fisheries in
the neighbourhood, and camped at the Point of
Rocks, the first spot on the south side of the lake
where the red granite again shows up, and the end
of the muskeg country that extends far on each
side of the Big River. Here we caught enough
whitefish with the nets to enable even the dogs to
have a small feed, and, as we killed forty ducks
while waiting for the wind to moderate, everybody
was satisfied. In the afternoon we put out
in a calm to paddle across the open traverse to
the first of a group of islands about fifteen miles
to the north. This traverse is the terror of the
lake for canoes, both in summer on account of the
heavy sea which gets up suddenly, and in winter
when the drifting snow in stormy weather obscures
everything and makes it a difficult matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to keep the course over the ice. On this occasion
we got over just in time, and, camping on
the nearest island of the group, were delayed for
two days by strong north-west winds accompanied
by showers of driving rain.</p>

<p>These islands, marked on the map as Simpson's
Group, extend for a hundred miles in a north-easterly
direction to Fond du Lac, and, if ever explored,
will be found to be in immense numbers,
varying in size, but all of the same red-granite
formation, covered with a scanty growth of pine,
birch, and willows. Many of them rise to a considerable
height, with the ridges generally running
south-west and north-east. A few moose
still inhabit the larger islands; but the big herds
of caribou from the Barren Ground that used
formerly to come here in their wanderings seem
to have deserted them of late years. An occasional
small pond gives harbourage for a few
wild-fowl, while wood-grouse, and in winter
ptarmigan, are plentiful. The bare outlying rocks
between the islands are the breeding-ground of
gulls and terns: divers and a few cormorants give
additional life to the lake in summer; but at the
first sign of cold weather the water-birds all leave
for a more temperate land, and a deathlike silence
settles over the frozen channels during the eight
months of winter.</p>

<p>The island on which we were encamped, being
the most westerly of the group, was exposed to
the full force of the gale. The heavy fresh-water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
seas broke with great violence on the weather
shore and on the numerous rocks, some
above water and others submerged, that make the
navigation of this part of the lake dangerous for
anything larger than a canoe. It was no easy
matter to get out our nets, even to leeward of the
island, and the supply of fish was very scanty;
dissatisfaction was prevalent in the camp, and
heavy inroads were made on the flour and bacon
that would have proved so useful later on. When
the weather moderated we started against a strong
head-wind, and a hard day's paddling brought us
to a spot known as the Inconnu Fishery, situated
on an island halfway to Fond du Lac. The Inconnu,
or Unknown Fish, is, I believe, entirely
restricted to the Mackenzie River country, and its
southernmost limits seem to be the rapids at Fort
Smith; it was thus named by the early <i>voyageurs</i>
of the Company, who were unable to classify it,
and even to this day there is a great variety of
opinion as to what family it is a member of: a
long thin fish, not unlike a misshapen salmon,
running up to fifteen pounds in weight, with
flabby and unpalatable flesh, it is held in very low
estimation in comparison with whitefish or trout,
and is only appreciated in hard times. At this
particular island it will take a bait readily, but
I never heard of its doing so in any other part
of the lake, although large numbers are caught
in the nets. There is some peculiarity in the
water which may account for this, as, even in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
dead of winter, there is generally an open hole
in the ice; and, in passing the Inconnu Fishery,
one must keep right ashore to avoid the treacherous
spot. Here we were wind-bound again,
and indeed for several days made very little head-way
against the northerly gales that seem almost
incessant at this time of year. We had a pleasant
spot to camp in every night, but not always
enough to eat, and it was the first of September
before we sighted the high land on the north side
of the lake. This was the first really fine day
we had had since leaving the fort, and, taking
advantage of it, we left the shelter of the islands,
made a bold crossing of the wide stretch of open
water, and camped among the scattering pines on
the northern mainland. Exactly opposite to us
was the narrow entrance to Christie's Bay of the
maps, extending some hundred miles to the east
and south-east, offering another tempting field for
exploration. On the west side of the entrance is
a remarkable many-coloured bluff, composed of
the soft rock used by the Indians for the manufacture
of their stone pipes, which are still in common
use.</p>

<p>The range of hills along the north shore, which
we now had to coast, average perhaps five hundred
feet in height, occasionally reaching a much
higher elevation, but without any conspicuous
peaks; the land begins to rise at once from the
lake, in many places taking the form of a steep
cliff. The vegetation is the same as that on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
south side of the lake, but more stunted, the pine
trees especially showing the increased rigour of
the climate; small birch trees are still numerous,
and the growth of the hardy willows is almost as
strong as at Fort Resolution. Fruit-bearing
plants are common. The small muskegs between
the ridges of rock are full of a much-prized yellow
berry, while blueberry bushes flourish in the
dry spots, and a few raspberries are still to be
seen; but strawberries, which used to be plentiful
on the south shore and among the islands, have
disappeared. I noticed here the low trailing plant
bearing a woolly red berry, known as Cannicannick
by the Indians to the west of the Rocky
Mountains, and used by them as tobacco; the
Slave Lake Indians sometimes smoke it, but prefer
the inner bark of the red willow; the Hudson's
Bay negrohead tobacco is in my opinion
much improved, as well as economized, by a mixture
with either of these substances. Countless
streams, the outlet of lakes on the elevated tableland
to the north, foam down the deep gulches
in the hillside, and confused masses of fallen timber
and rocks give evidence of the frequent land-slides
that take place during the spring thaws.</p>

<p>Again the north wind howled dismally down
the lake, and several more days were occupied in
reaching Fond du Lac. The enforced delay had
a depressing effect upon the whole party, as fish
were scarce, and paddling against continual head-winds
is always hard work. At last, on September<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
5th, passing through a narrow arm of the
lake with a perceptible current formed by the prevailing
winds, we came in sight of Fond du Lac.
A single house at the head of a snug little bay is
all that is left standing, but the ruins of others,
and a number of rough graves, show that at one
time it was a more populous place. It was formerly
an outpost of Fort Resolution, used as a depot
for collecting meat, and presided over in a
haphazard manner by King Beaulieu, who is still
rather sore about the abandonment of the post
and his own discharge from the Company's service.
The weather now became worse than ever,
snow and hail taking the place of rain and throwing
the first white mantle on the hill-tops. It was
evident that such a large party, crippled as we
were with women and children, would never be
able to reach the caribou, in the event of these
animals being far back from the Great Slave
Lake. We had met no Indians, and so had no
means of hearing the news of the caribou, which
forms the one topic of interest among the Dog-Rib
and Yellow Knife tribes who hunt in this
part of the country. Luckily trout and whitefish
were fairly abundant, some of the former reaching
such an enormous size that I am afraid to
hazard a guess at their weight, though I afterwards
saw one at the fort that turned the scale at
fifty-eight pounds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>We held a big council as to ways and means,
and, after much discussion, finally came to the decision
that our best chance was to leave the main
body of women and children with sufficient men
to attend to the nets for them, while the rest of
us pushed on to the north with our two biggest
canoes, in the hope of falling in with the caribou,
and afterwards the musk-ox. We were to leave
all the dogs at Fond du Lac, as we expected to
send back before the setting in of winter; only
two women, King's wife and daughter, were to
come with us to dry meat, dress deerskins, and
make moccasins. Besides them our crew consisted
of King Beaulieu, his sons François, José,
Paul, and Baptiste (a boy of twelve), Michel
(King's son-in-law), and a small Indian boy who
had thrown in his lot with us as the best visible
means of getting anything to keep him alive during
the autumn. All the provisions that I had
brought with me were exhausted, and we had
nothing but a dozen small dried whitefish when
we left Fond du Lac on September 7th to paddle
another thirty miles along the north shore before
leaving the lake. Our loads were cut down to the
smallest weight possible in order to save time on
the portages. I left my Paradox behind as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
ammunition was heavy, and trusted entirely to a
Winchester rifle; a pair of glasses and a blanket
about completed my share of the cargo. I had
no instruments for taking observations, no compass,
and no watch; and, take it all round, it was
a very poorly-equipped expedition. We made a
bad start, as, after an hour's travel across a deep
bay, we found ourselves storm-bound on a small
island, the canoes hauled up on the beach, and
such a heavy sea on all sides that we could not
get out a net. We spent an uncomfortable night
on the island, but the wind moderated a little in
the morning and we put out again. After being
once driven back to our refuge we managed to
reach the mainland, with the canoes half full of
water and our blankets and clothes soaked.
However, a good fire soon mended matters, and,
as we caught enough whitefish to stave off present
hunger, contentment reigned in the camp.</p>

<p>The next evening, after another long struggle
against the wind, we camped in the small bay at
which we intended to make our first portage, and
our long journey on the Great Slave Lake was
finished. Three ducks, our whole bag for the
day, and a kettle of black tea gave us a scanty
supper, and, as there was still a little daylight,
we each carried a small load to the top of the hill,
a distance of two miles, but were disappointed in
not seeing any caribou tracks. We thought we
had a chance of finding them close to the lake, but
as a matter of fact we had several days' journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
yet before we fell in with them. It now seemed
pretty certain that we were in for a spell of what
my companions alluded to as <i>les misères</i> till we
reached the meat-country, the joys of which
formed the chief subject of talk round the camp-fires.</p>

<p>With the first streak of light we began the portage
in a driving snowstorm, and long before
midday the rest of the cargo and the biggest canoe
were landed at the top of the steep climb; the
other canoe we abandoned, thinking one was
ample for our work in the Barren Ground. We
sat down for a smoke at the top of the hill, and
took our last view of the Great Slave Lake.
Looking southward we could see the far shore
and the unknown land beyond rising in terraces
to a considerable height, and very similar in appearance
to the range we were on. Ahead of us,
to the north, lay a broken rocky country sparsely
timbered and dotted with lakes, the nearest of
which, a couple of miles away, was the end of
our portage; a bleak and desolate country, already
white with snow and with a film of ice over
the smaller ponds. Three hundred miles in the
heart of this wilderness, far beyond the line where
timber ceases, lies the land of the musk-ox, to
which we were about to force our way, depending
entirely on our guns for food and for clothing
to withstand the intense cold that would soon be
upon us. A pair of hawks hovering overhead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
furnished the only signs of life, and the outlook
was by no means cheerful. As I was sitting on a
rock meditating upon these things old King came
up and said: "Let us finish the portage quickly;
it is dinner-time." I quite agreed with him, but
put his remark down as a rather unseasonable
joke, as I did not think there was a bite to eat
among us; but on reaching the lake I was pleasantly
surprised to see King fish out a lump of
bacon, which he had stowed away some time ago
after one of my lectures on improvidence. It was
really the last piece, and, although there was no
bread (and for the matter of that there was none
for the next three months) we all made a good
enough meal. The lake was of course named Lac
du Lard to commemorate this event.</p>

<p>I think no white man had ever passed through
this chain of lakes before, as Sir John Franklin
went up by a more westerly route, following the
course of the Yellow Knife River, while Hearne
and Back both left from the east end of the Great
Slave Lake; Stewart and Anderson, when they
were searching for survivors of Franklin's last ill-fated
expedition, reached the head waters of the
Great Fish River by a chain of lakes about eighty
miles to the eastward of my present route. If the
lakes were known among the Indians by any particular
names I enquired their meaning and preserved
them; the others I named from incidents in
the voyage or from the Company's officers of
Athabasca and Mackenzie River districts.</p>

<p>During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> the afternoon we made four more short
portages, passing through the same number of
lakes, some of them of a considerable size. We
kept a good look-out for the caribou but saw no
signs of them, and at dark, after a hard day's
work, camped on the east shore of the Lac de
Mort. It acquired this name from a disaster that
overwhelmed a large encampment of Yellow
Knives who were hunting here during one of
those epidemics of scarlet fever that have from
time to time ravaged the North. Most of the
hunters were too ill to walk, and, as game was
scarce, the horrors of starvation, combined with
disease, almost exterminated the band.</p>

<p>The next two days were occupied in the same
manner of travelling towards the north with numerous
portages. We could not catch any fish,
though we set a net every night, but killed enough
ducks to keep us alive without satisfying our ravenous
hunger. The weather was still cold, with
strong head-winds and frequent snowstorms.</p>

<p>On the third day we caught a big trout and
killed a loon and a wolverine, the latter after a
most exciting chase on a long point. In the next
portage accordingly we made a big feast, although
wolverines are only eaten in starving
times, as they are looked upon in the light of scavengers
and grave-robbers, and "<i>carcajou</i>-eater"
is a favourite term of contempt. On the present
occasion nobody made any objection, and in the
circumstances the despised meat tasted remarkably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
well. Our joy was soon cut short by finding
the next lake, which was more sheltered from the
wind than the others we had passed through, covered
with a sheet of ice sufficiently thick to prevent
the passage of a birch-bark canoe, while a
heavy snowstorm came on at the same time, making
matters look more gloomy than ever. King's
sons at once expressed their intention of returning
to Fond du Lac while the lakes behind them
were still open. King, however, here showed great
determination, and declared, with an unnecessary
amount of strong language, that he had the heart
of Beaulieu (the worst sort of heart, by the way),
and, when once he had started, would not turn
back without seeing the musk-ox. Eventually we
persuaded them to come on, and, carrying the canoe,
reduced our load to the very smallest amount
of necessaries. We then started on foot for an
expedition that would have most certainly ended
in disaster if we had gone on with it. I noticed
that the two women had the heaviest loads to carry,
but having myself as much as I cared about
for a long distance I made no remarks on the subject.
Luckily, after spending a night without eating
under the shelter of a bunch of dwarf pines,
we discovered the next lake to be almost clear of
ice; and carrying our canoe over the four-mile
portage we continued our journey as before, pushing
on as quickly as possible to reach the Lac du
Rocher, where the half-breeds were confident of
meeting the caribou, or, at the worst, to camp at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a spot well known to them where we might catch
fish enough for a temporary support. We had
now been in a half-starving condition for several
days, and were beginning to lose the strength
that we required for portaging and paddling
against the continual north wind.</p>

<p>On September 13th we reached the Lac du
Rocher, a large irregular sheet of water, so broken
up with bays and promontories that it is hard to
estimate its size. Camp was made on the south
side of the lake, and we set our nets and lines,
baited with carefully preserved pieces of whitefish,
while others explored the surrounding hills
for caribou tracks, but without success. The half-breeds
were all much put out by this failure, as
they have always found the Lac du Rocher a certainty
for caribou at this time of year, and were
unable to account for it, except by the theory
that the animals had altered the usual course of
their autumn migration and were passing to the
east of us. There was not a fish in the net when
we turned in; but a good trout was caught in the
middle of the night, and we all got up and finished
the last mouthful. Again we had no breakfast,
and the early morning found us discussing various
plans in rather a serious manner. The final
decision was that Paul and François should push
ahead to try and find the caribou, while the rest
of us moved the camp to the north end of the
lake and worked the fishing till their return; six
days were allowed them for their trip, after which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
each party was to act independently, and we were
all to get out of the awkward situation in the
best way we could.</p>

<p>Accordingly we took the canoes across the lake
as soon as our hunters had started, and put up our
deerskin lodge in the shelter of a clump of well-grown
pine trees; we tried the hand-lines for
hours without any better result than completely
numbing our fingers, and towards evening set the
net, also without any luck. I took my rifle and
walked two or three miles back from the lake, but
beyond an Arctic fox, which I missed at long
range, saw nothing edible.</p>

<p>There is no better camp than a well-set-up
lodge with a good fire crackling in the middle, and
in this respect we were comfortable enough, but
the shortness of food was telling rapidly. We
had made no pretence at eating all day, and since
leaving Fond du Lac had subsisted almost entirely
on tea and tobacco, while even on the Great Slave
Lake provisions had been none too plentiful. We
passed the evening smoking, and, as I have found
usual in these cases, talking of all the good things
we had ever eaten, while eyes shone in the firelight
with the brilliancy peculiar to the early
stages of starvation. Outside the lodge the wind
was moderated; the northern lights, though it was
still early in the year, were flashing brightly across
the sky, and far away in the distance we could
hear the ominous howling of wolves. Late in the
night I awoke, and, on lighting my pipe, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
greeted by King with the remark: "Ah! Monsieur,
une fois j'ai goûté le pain avec le beurre; le
bon Dieu a fait ces deux choses là exprès pour
manger ensemble."</p>

<p>Long before daylight we put off in the canoe
to visit the net, and to our great joy found five
fair-sized trout, quite enough to relieve all anxiety
for the day; the weather also had improved, turning
much warmer, with the snow rapidly thawing.
The half-breeds, who are all Catholics, held a
short service, as it was Sunday morning and they
are very particular in this respect. Afterwards
we all went out hunting, but only two or three
ptarmigan, the first we had seen, were killed, and
there were still no signs of the caribou. The
country here is much less rugged than on first
leaving the Great Slave Lake, and the rolling hills
are covered with a small plant, halfway between
heather and moss, bearing a small black berry,
and growing in thick bunches wherever the soil
is capable of producing it. This plant, and a wiry
black moss which grows in patches on the flat
rocks, are much used as fuel in dry weather, if no
wood is available; in wet weather they are of
course useless. The hollows between the ridges
are generally muskegs, thawed out to the depth
of a foot, producing a long coarse grass, and in
many places a plentiful growth of a dwarf variety
of the Labrador tea, an excellent substitute
for the product of China. Huge glacial boulders
lie scattered in every direction, many of them balanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in an extraordinary manner on the points
of smaller stones, which seem to have been of
softer substance and gradually worn away. In
other spots are patches of broken rocks, covering
a large extent of ground and very difficult to
travel on, especially when a light coating of snow
makes them slippery, and conceals the deep holes
in which a leg might easily be snapped; even the
caribou, sure-footed as they are, will often make
a long detour in preference to taking the risk of a
fall among these rocks. Lakes of all sizes and
shapes abound on every side, connected by small
streams that find their way into the Slave Lake
one hundred miles to the southward. Pine timber
is now very scarce and mostly small, growing in
sheltered spots with long stretches where not a
tree is visible. A fairly thick stem starts from the
ground and immediately spreads out into a bush
with the branches growing downwards, and the
top of the tree seldom reaching a height of ten
feet. Sometimes, however, even as far out as
this, a bunch of really well-grown trees is to be
found, probably having the advantages of better
soil to spring from. A very few birch sticks, invaluable
to the Indian for making snow-shoes,
still manage to exist, and patches of scrub willow
are frequent. The general appearance of the
country and the vegetation, with the exception of
the timber, reminded me strongly of the desert
of Arnavatn in the interior of Iceland.</p>

<p>A great variety of mosses and lichens flourish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
here and in the true Barren Ground outside the
tree limit, the <i>tripe des roches</i> which has played
such a conspicuous part in the story of Arctic
exploration being particularly abundant at this
spot. The formation of the rocks is still red
granite, with a good deal of mica showing in the
boulders.</p>

<p>Late in the evening we heard a gun, and, on
our replying, four or five shots were fired in rapid
succession, the signal of good news; soon afterwards
Paul and François came in, each carrying
a small load of meat, which we finished promptly.
They had fallen in with the caribou about thirty
miles on, and reported them to be moving south
in great numbers; we had now no hesitation in
pushing on to meet them, and were all jubilant at
the thought of good times coming. The next day
was warm again with south-west wind, and, after
passing through the Lac du Corbeau (named
from our little Indian, who had acquired the title
of <i>Chasseur du Corbeau</i> from an unsuccessful
hunt he had made after a raven at one of our
hungry camps), we portaged into Lake Camsell,
a fine sheet of water over twenty miles in length,
running more to the east than the other lakes we
had passed, full of small islands, and with rather
more timber than usual on its shores.</p>

<p>For the first time we could put down our
paddles, and, hoisting a large red blanket for a
sail, ran in front of the steady fair wind; the
water was blue, the sun pleasantly warm, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
snow had almost disappeared. In the afternoon
there was a cry of <i>Et-then, Et-then!</i> (the caribou),
and we saw a solitary bull standing against
the sky-line on the top of an island close to the
east shore of the lake. As soon as we were out
of sight we landed and quickly surrounded him;
he made a break for the water, but one of the
half-breeds, in hiding behind a rock, dropped him
before he put to sea. It was a full-grown bull in
prime condition, the velvet not yet shed, but the
horns quite hard underneath.</p>

<p>A scene of great activity now commenced.
There was no more thought of travelling that
night, and, while two men were skinning and cutting
up the caribou, the others unloaded and carried
ashore the canoe, lit a fire, and got ready the
kettles for a feast that was to make up for all
the hard times just gone through. There was
plenty of meat for everybody to gorge themselves,
and we certainly made a night of it, boiling and
roasting till we had very nearly finished the whole
animal. I could not quite keep up with the others
at this first trial of eating powers, but after a
couple of weeks among the caribou I was fully
able to hold my own. We seemed at length to
have found the land of plenty, as ptarmigan were
very numerous, just losing the last of their pretty
brown plumage and putting on their white dresses
to match the snow, which would soon drive them
for food and shelter into the thick pine woods
round the shores of the Great Slave Lake.</p>

<p>We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> had to sleep off the effects of over-eating,
and it was late in the day before we started down
the lake. After two or three hours' sailing at a
slow pace we spied a band of caribou, again on an
island. With unnecessary haste we made for the
land, and, through watching the deer instead of
the water, ran the canoe on a sharp submerged
rock, tearing an ugly hole in the birch-bark. We
all stepped overboard up to the waist, carried the
cargo ashore, and, leaving the women to stitch up
the canoe with the bark and fibre that is always
kept handy when away from the birch woods,
started in pursuit of the caribou. The result was
that after a great deal of bad shooting we killed
sixteen on the island, while the canoe, hastily
patched up, with a kettle going steadily to bale
out and the women paddling and shouting lustily,
succeeded in picking up two more that tried to
escape by swimming.</p>

<p>The evening was passed in skinning and cutting
up the meat, which was stowed away in
rough <i>caches</i> of rocks to keep it safe from the
wolves and wolverines. These animals are always
very plentiful in attendance on the big herds
of caribou, and are often the cause of much annoyance
to the hunter through stealing meat that
he is relying upon for subsistence; in many places
where the rocks are small it is impossible to build
a <i>cache</i> strong enough to keep out the wolverines,
which are possessed of wonderful strength for
their size.</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> following day while Michel, Paul, and myself
were walking overland to join the canoe at
the end of the lake, we fell in with another band
of caribou, and, as the rest of the party landed
at an opportune moment, we caught the animals
on a long point and made another big slaughter
of seventeen, among them some old bulls with
very fine heads. A young bull, nearly pure-white
in colour, came my way, and I secured him, but
unfortunately the skin was afterwards stolen by
wolverines. We had now plenty of meat to establish
a permanent camp, and set up our lodge at
the end of Lake Camsell with the intention of
leaving the women and boys to collect and dry the
meat and dress the skins, while the men were
away on a short hunt after musk-ox before the
lakes set fast with ice.</p>

<p>We were now within a short distance of the
last woods, if a few bunches of dwarf pines, at
intervals of several miles, can be called woods,
and were about to push out into the Barren
Ground, where, with the exception of an occasional
patch of small scrub willow, all timber
ceases.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>In the various records of Arctic exploration,
and especially in those dealing with the Barren
Ground, there is frequent mention of deer, reindeer,
and caribou, leaving the casual reader in
doubt as to how many species of deer inhabit
the rocky wilderness between the woods and the
Arctic Sea. As a matter of fact, the Barren
Ground caribou (which name I prefer, as distinguishing
it from the woodland caribou, the
only other member of the reindeer tribe existing
on the American continent) is the sole representative
of the Cervidæ found in this locality.</p>

<p>The chief distinction between this animal and
its cousin the woodland caribou, or <i>caribou des
bois fort</i> in the half-breed parlance, lies in the
different size, the latter having by far the advantage
in height and weight. I have had no opportunity
of weighing specimens of either kind, but
should imagine that the woodland must be fully
a third the heavier of the two. I cannot agree
with some of the natural history books which
state that the smaller animals carry the larger
horns, as of all the Barren Ground caribou that
we killed I never saw any with horns to compare
with the giant antlers of the woodland caribou of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Newfoundland or British Columbia; more irregular,
if possible, they may be, and perhaps have a
greater number of points, but they are far behind
in weight, spread, and size of beam. The perfect
double plough is more often seen in the smaller
specimen, the larger animal being usually provided
with only one, or with one plough and a
spike. In colour they closely resemble each other,
but there is rather more white noticeable in the
representative of the Barren Ground, especially in
the females, while the texture of the coat, as is
to be expected, is finer in the smaller variety.
The hoofs have the same curious "snow-shoe"
formation in both cases.</p>

<p>The range of the Barren Ground caribou appears
to be from the islands in the Arctic Sea to
the southern part of Hudson's Bay, while the
Mackenzie River is the limit of their western
wandering, although not many years ago they are
known to have crossed the Slave River in the
neighbourhood of Fort Smith. In the summer
time they keep to the true Barren Ground, but in
the autumn, when their feeding-grounds are covered
with snow, they seek the hanging moss in
the woods. From what I could gather from the
Yellow Knife Indians at the east end of the Great
Slave Lake, and from my own personal experience,
it was late in October, immediately after
the rutting season, that the great bands of caribou,
commonly known as <i>La Foule</i>, mass up on
the edge of the woods, and start for food and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
shelter afforded by the stronger growth of pines
farther southward. A month afterwards the males
and females separate, the latter beginning to work
their way north again as early as the end of February;
they reach the edge of the woods in April,
and drop their young far out towards the sea-coast
in June, by which time the snow is melting
rapidly and the ground showing in patches. The
males stay in the woods till May and never reach
the coast, but meet the females on their way inland
at the end of July; from this time they stay
together till the rutting season is over and it is
time to seek the woods once more.</p>

<p>The horns are mostly clear of velvet towards
the end of September, but some of the females
carry it later even than this; the old bulls shed
their antlers early in December, and the young
ones do the same towards the end of that month,
the females being some weeks later. In June
both sexes present a very shabby appearance, as
the old coats have grown long and white and are
falling off in patches; by the end of July the
new hair has grown, and the skins are then in
their best condition.</p>

<p>The caribou are extremely uncertain in their
movements, seldom taking the same course in
two consecutive years, and thus affording ground
for the universal cry in the North that the caribou
are being killed off. I think there is really much
truth in the statement that they keep a more easterly
route than formerly, as they seldom come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
in large quantities to the Mackenzie River, where
they used to be particularly numerous in winter.
This is in a great measure accounted for by the
fact that great stretches of the country have been
burnt, and so rendered incapable of growing the
lichen so dearly beloved by these animals. The
same thing applies at Fort Resolution, where,
within the last decade, the southern shore of the
Great Slave Lake has been burnt and one of the
best ranges totally destroyed.</p>

<p>One point that seems to bear out the theory of
a more easterly movement is that within the last
three years the caribou have appeared in their
thousands at York Factory on the west side of
Hudson's Bay, where they have not been seen for
over thirty years; but I cannot believe, judging
from the vast herds that I myself saw, that there
is any danger of the caribou being exterminated.</p>

<p>It is absurd to say that the white man is killing
them off, as no white man ever fires a shot at
them unless they pass very close to a Company's
establishment, and the Indians are themselves
surely dying out year by year. Nor is it any
argument to say that the Indians sometimes
starve to death from want of success in hunting,
as a glance at Hearne's <i>Journey to the Northern
Ocean in 1771</i> will show that the same state of
affairs prevailed before the Company had penetrated
to the Great Slave Lake or Mackenzie
River. Starvation will always be one of the features
of a Northern Indian's life, owing to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
own improvidence; his instinct is to camp close on
the tracks of the caribou and move as they move;
a permanent house and a winter's supply of meat
are an abomination to him.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of firearms the Indian
has lost much of his old hunting lore! a snare is
almost a thing of the past, but is still occasionally
used when ammunition is scarce. It is no hard
matter to kill caribou in the open country, for the
rolling hills usually give ample cover for a stalk,
and even on flat ground they are easily approached
at a run, as they will almost invariably
circle head to wind and give the hunter a chance
to cut them off. But it is with the spear that the
vast slaughter in the summer is annually made.
The best swimming-places are known and carefully
watched, and woe betide a herd of caribou if
once surrounded in a lake by the small hunting-canoes.
One thrust of the spear, high up in the
loins and ranging forward, does the work. There
is no idea of sparing life, no matter what the
age or sex of the victim may be; the lake is red
with blood and covered with sometimes several
hundred carcasses, of which fully one-half are
thrown away as not fat enough to be eaten by
men who may be starving in a month. Surely
this should exterminate the game; but, if one
remonstrates with the Indians at the waste, the
ready answer comes: "Our fathers did this and
have taught us to do the same; they did not kill
off the caribou, and after we are gone there will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
be plenty for our children." These animals are
easily induced to swim at any particular spot by
putting up a line of rocks at right angles to the
water, and a line of pine bush planted in the snow
across a frozen lake has the same effect; the
caribou will not pass it, but following it along
fall an easy prey to the hunter lying in ambush
at the end of the line. In the winter they are
killed in great numbers on the small lakes in the
timber, as they seem disinclined to leave the open
lake and will often run close up to the gun rather
than take to the woods. I have heard this accounted
for by the suggestion that they take the
report of the gun for a falling tree and are afraid
of being struck if they venture off the lake; but
I fancy their natural curiosity has a great deal to
do with this extraordinary behaviour. It frequently
happens that they will run backwards
and forwards within range till the last of the
band is killed.</p>

<p>The caribou supplies the Indian with nearly all
the necessaries of life; it gives him food, clothing,
house, and the equivalent of money to spend
at the fort. He leaves the trading-post, after
one of his yearly visits, with a supply of ammunition,
tea, and tobacco, a blanket or two, and, if
he has made a good season's hunt, is perhaps
lucky enough to have taken one of the Company's
duffel <i>capotes</i> (about the best form of greatcoat
that I have ever seen). He has a wife and family
waiting for him somewhere on the shore of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
big lake where fish are plentiful, expecting a
gaudy dress, a shawl, or a string of beads from
the fort, but relying entirely on the caribou for
maintenance during the awful cold of the coming
winter. The journey up till they fall in with the
caribou is usually full of hardships, but once they
have reached the hunting-ground and found game
a great improvement in affairs takes place; the
hunter is busy killing, while the women dry meat
and make grease, dress the skins for moccasins,
mittens, and gun-covers, and cut <i>babiche</i>, which
takes the place of string for lacing snow-shoes
and many other purposes. For the hair-coats,
which everybody, men, women, and children,
wear during the cold season, the best skins are
those of the young animals killed in July or August,
as the hair is short and does not fall off so
readily as in coats made from the skin of a full-grown
caribou; while the strong sinews lying
along the backbone of an old bull make the very
best thread for sewing. Anything that is left
over after supplying the whole family finds a
ready sale at the fort, where there is always a
demand for dried meat, tongue-grease, dressed
skins, and <i>babiche</i>, so that the Dog-Ribs and Yellow
Knives, whose country produces little fur,
with the exception of musk-ox robes, are thus enabled
to afford some few of the white man's luxuries,
tea and tobacco being especially dear to
the Indian's heart.</p>

<p>A good hunter kills the caribou with discretion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
according to their condition at various seasons of
the year. After the females leave the woods in
the early spring he has of course only the males
to fall back on, and these are usually poor till
August, when the bones are full of marrow and
the back-fat commences to grow. By the middle
of September this back-fat, or <i>depouille</i> as it is
called in Northern patois, has reached a length
of a foot or more forward from the tail, and, as
it is sometimes a couple of inches thick and extends
right across the back, it is a great prize for
the lucky hunter. It is a point of etiquette that
when two or more Indians are hunting in company,
the <i>depouille</i> and tongue belong to the man
who did the killing, while the rest of the meat is
shared in common.</p>

<p>Towards the end of October, when the rutting
season is over, the males are in very poor condition.
The females then come into demand, but
it is not till the end of the year that they show
any back-fat at all, and this is always small in
comparison with that of a bull killed in the Fall.
The summer months are generally spent by the
Indians far out in the Barren Ground, and then,
as I have said, they slaughter everything that
comes within reach of their spear in the most indiscriminate
manner.</p>

<p>Excepting in times of plenty, when the utmost
recklessness with provisions is displayed, there are
very few parts of the caribou thrown away, and
often the actual stomach is the only thing left; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
blood is carefully preserved, and some of the intestines
are prized as great luxuries. If one does
not see the actual preparations for cooking they
are good enough, but the favourite dish of all, the
young unborn caribou cut from its dead mother,
I could never take kindly to, although it is considered
a delicacy among the Indians throughout
the northern part of Canada. Another morsel
held in high esteem is the udder of a milk-giving
doe, which is usually roasted on the spot where
the animal is killed. Of the external parts the
ribs and brisket rank highest, the haunches being
generally reserved for dog's food; a roast head
is not to be despised, and a well-smoked tongue
is beyond all praise. It was the caribou of the
Barren Ground that provided the reindeers'
tongues formerly exported in such quantities by
the Hudson's Bay Company. The general method
of cooking everything in the lodge is by boiling,
which takes most of the flavour out of the meat,
but has the advantage of being easy and economical
of firewood.</p>

<p>The marrow is usually eaten raw, and, as there
is no blood visible in the bones of a fat animal,
it is not such a disgusting habit as it seems to be
at first sight, and one readily accustoms oneself
to the fashion. Everybody who has travelled in
the North has experienced the same craving for
grease as the cold becomes more intense. In the
case of a white man the enforced absence of flour
and all vegetable food may be an additional cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
for this feeling; but it is a fact that you can cheerfully
gnaw a solid block of grease or raw fat that
it would make you almost sick to look at in a land
of temperate climate and civilized methods of living.</p>

<p>The Indian is by no means the only enemy of
the caribou. Along the shore of the Arctic Sea
live straggling bands of Esquimaux who kill great
quantities of these persecuted animals, although
employing more primitive methods than their
southern neighbours; it is done, moreover, at the
most fatal season of the year, just as the females
have arrived at the coast and are dropping their
young. Then there are the ever-hungry wolves
and wolverines that hang with such pertinacity
on the travelling herds and rely upon them entirely
for subsistence. It is rarely that a caribou
once singled out can escape. The wolves hunt
in bands and seldom leave the track they have
selected; the chase lasts for many hours, till the
victim, wearied by the incessant running, leaves
the band and his fate is sealed; he has a little
the best of the pace at first but not the staying
power, and is soon pulled to the ground. Many
a time I witnessed these courses, and once disturbed
half a dozen wolves just as they commenced
their feast on a caribou in which life was
hardly extinct, and I took the tongue and <i>depouille</i>
for my share of the hunt.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i078.jpg"><img src="images/i078-t.jpg" width="400" height="293" alt="A Dead White Wolf" title="" />
</a><span class="caption"><br />A Dead White Wolf</span>
</div>

<p>I only saw wolves of two colours, white and
black, during my stay in the North, although I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
heard much talk of grey wolves. There was
some sort of disease, resembling mange, among
them in the winter of 1889-90, which had the effect
of taking off all their hair, and, judging from
the number of dead that were lying about, must
have considerably thinned their numbers. They
do not seem to be dangerous to human beings
except when starving; but the Indians have stories
of crazy wolves that run into the lodges, kill the
children, and play general havoc. I know that
they do at times get bold under stress of hunger,
as my own hauling dogs were set upon and eaten
by them while harnessed to the sleigh close to the
house at Fond du Lac; nothing remained but the
sleigh, and a string of bells that must have proved
less tempting than the rest of the harness.</p>

<p>I scarcely credit the statement I have often
heard made, that the wolverines will kill a full-grown
caribou, although it is possible that they
may attack the young ones. They follow the
herds more for the pickings they can get from
the feasts of the wolves, and are content with
showing their fighting powers on hares and ptarmigan;
if meat is not to be had they will eat berries
freely, and their flesh is then not so bad as
after they have had a long course of meat. The
<i>carcajou</i> possesses great strength and cunning in
removing rocks and breaking into a <i>cache</i>; it
climbs with great agility, and has a mean trick of
throwing down a marten-trap from behind and
taking out the bait, and is generally credited by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the Indian with more wiles than the devil himself.
It is an animal common enough in many
parts of Canada, but is rarely seen in the woods
on account of its retiring habits. In the Barren
Ground, however, I had many opportunities of
watching them through the glasses as they worked
at the carcass of a caribou or musk-ox, and was
much struck by the enormous power exercised
by so small an animal; in travelling it seems to
use only one pace, the <i>lope</i> of the Western prairies,
which it is said to be able to keep up for
an indefinite time.</p>

<p>Another great source of annoyance to the caribou
are the two sorts of gadfly which use these
animals as a hatching-ground for their eggs. The
biggest kind, which seem the most numerous, deposit
their eggs on the back, and, as they hatch
out, the grubs bore through the skin and prey on
the surrounding flesh. They begin to show in October,
and grow bigger through the winter till
the following spring, the number of holes in many
cases rendering the skin absolutely useless for
dressing. The other kind of fly lays its eggs
in the nostril, with the result that in the months
of May and June a nest of writhing grubs, slimmer
and more lively than the grubs under the
skin, appears at the root of the tongue; at this
time of year the caribou may be often seen to
stop and shake their heads violently, with their
horns close to the ground, evidently greatly troubled
by these grubs. Of the latter kind the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
who travelled with me in the summer have
a great horror, warning me to be very careful not
to eat them, as they have an idea they would
surely grow in a man's throat; and whenever we
killed an animal, the first operation was to cut off
its head and remove these unpleasant objects. By
the beginning of August all the grubs have
dropped off and the holes healed up, while the
new coat has grown and the skins are then in
their best condition.</p>

<p>I could not hear of any attempt ever having
been made to domesticate the caribou, though
there is no good reason why they should not be
trained to do the same work as the reindeer of
Northern Europe. If this were brought about
it would do away with the greatest difficulty of
winter travel, the trouble about dog's food, which
cripples any attempt to make a long journey except
where game is very plentiful; wherever there
was green timber and hanging moss the caribou
might find its own supper, and would always come
in better for food than a thin dog in times of starvation.</p>

<p>The caribou afford a wide scope for the superstitions
so ingrained in the Indian nature, and
the wildest tales without the least foundation are
firmly believed in. One widely-spread fancy is
that they will entirely forsake a country if anyone
throws a stick or stone at them, and their disappearance
from the neighbourhood of Fort Resolution
is accounted for by the fact of a boy, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
had no gun, joining in the chase when the caribou
were passing in big numbers, and clubbing one
to death with a stick; this belief holds good also
down the Mackenzie River, as does the idea that
these animals on some occasions vanish either into
the air or under the ground. The Indians say
that sometimes when following close on a herd
they arrive at a spot where the tracks suddenly
cease and the hunter is left to wonder and starve.
It is very unlucky to let the dogs eat any part of
the head, and the remaining bones are always
burnt or put up in a tree out of reach, the dogs
going hungry, unless there happens to be some
other kind of meat handy. Another rather more
sensible superstition, presumably invented by the
men, is that no woman must eat the gristle of
the nose (a much-esteemed delicacy), or she will
infallibly grow a beard.</p>

<p>Such are examples of the endless traditions told
of the caribou, which will always form the chief
topic of conversation in the scattered lodges of
the Dog-Ribs and Yellow Knives.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>On the 17th of September we left our camp
at the north end of Lake Camsell for a short expedition
in search of musk-ox, which we expected
to find within fifty miles of the edge of the
woods. By this time we had all fattened up, and
entirely recovered from the effects of the short
rations we had had to put up with before we fell
in with the caribou.</p>

<p>My crew consisted at starting of King, Paul,
François, Michel, and José; but as the two latter
speedily showed signs of discontent I made no
objection to their turning back, and despatched
them to Fond du Lac to get ready the dog-sleighs,
snow-shoes, and everything necessary for winter
travel. As a matter of fact they did absolutely
nothing except squander a relay of provisions and
ammunition that had been sent on by the trading-boat
from the fort to meet me at Fond du Lac.
I was not sorry to see the last of them, as four
of us were quite enough to work the canoe, and
a small party naturally stands in less danger of
starvation than a big one; moreover, they were
certainly the most quarrelsome men in the camp,
which is saying a good deal, as we had all done
our fair share in that way since leaving the fort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>We started without any meat, expecting to find
caribou everywhere, and in this respect we had
great luck all the time we were out; but we were
not so well off for shelter. We had brought only
one lodge from Fond du Lac, which was of
course left for the women, while we took the
chance of what weather might come, hunting the
lee-side of a big rock towards evening, and often
finding ourselves covered with an extra blanket
of snow (<i>le couvert du bon Dieu</i>, as King called
it) in the morning.</p>

<p>The plan of campaign was to reach the musk-ox
by canoe and bring back as many robes as we
could carry before the winter set in; or, failing
this, to kill and <i>cache</i> caribou along our line of
travel, so that we should have meat to help us
reach the musk-ox with dog-sleighs after the
heavy snow had fallen and all the caribou had
passed into the woods.</p>

<p>I named the first lake that we portaged into
King Lake, a narrow sheet of water some five
miles in length, and here we were storm-bound
all day by a northerly gale, the force of the wind
being so great that we could not move the canoe
to windward, although the water was smooth
enough. The weather improving in the morning,
we paddled down the lake and passed into a small
stream running out of its north end. A couple
of miles down stream, with a portage over a small
cascade (the thirty-fourth and last portage that
we made with the big canoe), brought us to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
huge lake running in a south-east and north-west
direction, said to be the longest of all the lakes
in this part of the country, and by the Indians'
account four good days' travel, or over one hundred
miles in length; the part that I saw is certainly
over fifty miles, and is said to be not half
the total distance. The lake is narrow in most
places, and cut up by long points into numerous
bays; there are a great many islands, particularly
at the north-east end, similar in appearance to the
main shore, which is just like the country I have
described at the Lac du Rocher, except that at
the end of the big lake the hills reach a greater
elevation, and present more the aspect of a regular
range, than in any other part of the Barren
Ground that I saw.</p>

<p>The position of Mackay Lake, as I named it
after Dr. Mackay of the Athabasca district, is
worthy of remark, as it is the best starting-point
from which to work the most important streams
of both watersheds. It lies very nearly on the
height of land between the Great Slave Lake and
the Arctic Ocean; its west end must be but a short
portage from the Yellow Knife River, while from
its eastern extremity runs out the large stream,
named by Anderson the Outram, but more generally
known as Lockhart's River, from the fact of
its falling into the Great Slave Lake at Lockhart's
house, which was established for the relief
of Stewart and Anderson when they went
in search of the missing Franklin Expedition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
The Great Fish, or Back's River, which they descended
on that occasion, heads within half a mile
of the north bay of Aylmer Lake, lying next below
Mackay Lake, on Lockhart's River. Fifteen
miles to the north is another large sheet of water
known to my companions as the Lac de Gras,
through which the Coppermine River runs on its
course direct to the Arctic Sea.</p>

<p>The point at which we fell on Lake Mackay is
about the edge of the woods, and here we camped
for the last time with pine timber, finding a small
hunting-canoe which some of the Beaulieus had
left during the previous autumn. This we decided
to take with us, and it proved extremely
useful later on in crossing the Coppermine.</p>

<p>On Sunday, September 22nd, with a fresh fair
wind and our blanket pulling strong, we ran for
several hours in a north-east direction; the little
canoe which we carried athwartship made the
steering difficult, as her bow and stern kept striking
the tops of the big waves that were running
after us, but we met with no accident except the
carrying away of our mast.</p>

<p>We were continually in sight of large bands of
caribou, but they seemed to take little notice of
the extraordinary apparition. Towards evening
we saw a herd on a long point projecting far out
from the south shore of the lake, and, thinking it
would be a good place to make a <i>cache</i>, landed
inside them and walked down the point in line.
We had the animals completely hemmed in, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
when they charged through us, nine dropped to
quick shooting at short range. There was little
fuel of any kind on the spot, and we had to eat
our meat almost raw, as is the fashion of the
Barren Ground on these occasions. In the morning
we ferried all the carcasses to a convenient
island close to the point, put them in <i>cache</i> among
the rocks, and proceeded down the lake, camping
at sundown at the head of a small bay near its
north-east end.</p>

<p>The weather now changed, and once more the
north wind came howling across the open country
straight from the Arctic Sea, and a steady
continuous frost set in. We hauled up the big
canoe and set out on foot, taking with us only
our rifles and ammunition, a blanket apiece, and a
couple of small kettles, besides the little canoe,
which proved an awkward load to carry against
the strong head-wind. We must have walked
about twenty miles, occasionally making use of
a lake for the canoe, when we reached the south
shore of the Lac de Gras, much disappointed in
seeing no musk-ox or caribou all day.</p>

<p>The Lac de Gras is much broader than Lake
Mackay, and rounder in shape, although at one
spot it is nearly cut in half by points stretching
out from each side. The Coppermine River runs
in at the east and out at the west end, and the
distance is not great to the site of Fort Enterprise,
Sir John Franklin's wintering place in 1820,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and the scene of the awful disasters which befell
his first overland expedition.</p>

<p>We were now hard up for provisions again,
and the first daylight found us hunting for something
to eat. Two of us walked along the shore,
while the others paddled the canoe, but we could
find neither musk-ox nor caribou; at midday we
met and changed places, King and myself making
rather a bold crossing in the shaky little canoe,
while Paul and François walked round. On approaching
the north shore of the lake we noticed
a raven rise and throw himself on his back in the
air, uttering the curious gurgling note which always
seems to imply satisfaction. King exclaimed,
"See the raven putting down his load!
there is something to eat there"; and true enough
there was, for we found the carcasses of eight
musk-ox, killed, as we afterwards heard, a month
before by a party of Yellow Knives, who had
driven the animals into the water and massacred
the whole band. Half a dozen gulls flapped away
heavily, and we caught sight of a wolverine sneaking
off as we came near. Neither of us much
fancied the appearance of the feast that lay before
us, but we had eaten nothing for some time, and
one is not particular in such cases, especially as
it is never certain when the next meal will turn
up. We robbed from the wolverines and ravens,
and, signalling to Paul and François, made a meal
of the half-putrid flesh in a little patch of willow
scrub that happened to be close at hand. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
never pleasant to find the game you are hunting
killed by somebody else, but in this instance it
was a relief to know that we had a supply of
meat, such as it was, to fall back upon in case
we came to grief later on.</p>

<p>After supper we crossed the Coppermine, a big
deep stream even here, with a current of a mile
and a half an hour, running out of another lake
which stretched northward and eastward as far
as we could see. Here we left the small canoe
to cross with on our return, and walked on late
into the night, hoping to find some more willows,
but eventually made a wretchedly cold camp without
fire on a long promontory, to which we always
after alluded as Le Point de Misère. A
light snowstorm made us still more uncomfortable,
and it was well on in the next afternoon before
we found willows enough to make a fire,
sighting almost immediately afterwards a big
band of caribou. We killed eight, and, as all the
small lakes were firmly frozen over by this time,
were able to make the safest form of <i>cache</i> by
breaking the ice and throwing the meat into shoal
water, which would at once begin to freeze and
defy all the efforts of the wolverines. Two
months afterwards we chopped out this meat,
and found it fresh and palatable, although the
outside was discoloured by its long soaking.
When we had finished our <i>cache</i> we lit a comparatively
big fire in a bunch of well-grown willows
and spent the rest of the day in eating and mending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
our moccasins, which were all badly worn
out by the rough walking of the last few days.
We had left our main camp badly provided in this
respect, as the women had not had sufficient time
to dress any skins before we started, and in consequence
we were all troubled with sore feet during
our wanderings in search of the musk-ox.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, now we did not want them,
the ptarmigan appeared again in great quantities,
although we had not seen any since leaving our
big canoe. The only other birds remaining were
a few hawks, owls, gulls, and ravens; the wild-fowl
had all left, and as a matter of fact we had
come across very few since leaving the Great
Slave Lake. About this time, too, we killed the
first Arctic hare, an animal by no means to be
despised, as it is fully as big as an English hare
and will at a pinch provide a meal for a small
party; at this time of year they are completely
white, with the exception of the tips of the ears
which are black; they are usually tame, and, being
very conspicuous before the snow covers the
ground, afford an excellent mark for the rifle.</p>

<p>On this day we crossed a peculiar ridge composed
of fine gravel and sand, resembling at a distance
a high railway embankment. It is a well-known
landmark for the Indians, and is said by
them to stretch, with few interruptions from the
east end of the Athabasca Lake to the east end of
Great Bear Lake.</p>

<p>September 27th was a red-letter day, marking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the death of the first musk-ox. Soon after leaving
camp we came to a rough piece of country,
full of patches of the broken rocks that I have
already described, and, mounting a small hill, saw
a single old bull walking directly towards us at a
distance of three hundred yards. We lay down
in the snow, and I had a capital chance of watching
him through the glasses as he picked his way
quietly over the slippery rocks, a sight which went
far to repay all the trouble we had taken in penetrating
this land of desolation. In crossing an
occasional piece of level ground he walked with
a curious rolling motion, probably accounted for
by the waving of the long hair on the flanks; this
hair reaches almost to the ground, and gives the
legs such an exaggerated appearance of shortness
that, at first sight, one would declare the animal
to be incapable of any rapid motion. The shaggy
head was carried high, and when he finally pulled
up at sight of us, within forty yards, with his
neck slightly arched and a gleam of sunshine
lighting up the huge white boss formed by the
junction of the horns, he presented a most formidable
appearance. His fate was not long in
doubt, as my first shot settled him, and the main
object of my trip was accomplished; whatever
might happen after this, I could always congratulate
myself on having killed a musk-ox, and this
made up for a great deal of the misery that we
afterwards had to undergo.</p>

<p>Although not absolutely prime, this animal was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
a fine specimen of an old bull, with the yellow
marking on the back clearly defined, and as good
a head as any I saw during my stay in the musk-ox
country. We took the whole skin, with head,
horns, and hoofs, and <i>cached</i> it among the rocks,
where I am sorry to say it lies to this day; I intended
to pick it up in the course of our winter
hunt, but unfortunately we were caught in a
snowstorm on the Lac de Gras, and were unable
to find the <i>cache</i>. In the evening we scattered
over the country, hoping to find a band of musk-ox,
but another bull, killed by Paul, was the only
one seen.</p>

<p>On the following day the frost was much
keener; the smaller lakes and the sheltered bays
in the big one were set fast, and we began to realise
that the sooner we started back the better
chance we had of getting across Mackay Lake
with the canoe, and avoiding the long detour to
cross Lockhart's River, which was sure to remain
open much longer than the lakes. The winter
was coming on quickly, and we were badly provided
with clothes to withstand its severity; our
moccasins were in rags, and everybody showed
signs of being footsore. By rough reckoning we
were about on the 65th degree of latitude, and it
seemed too reckless to push on any further towards
the North, as already we were separated
from the nearest timber by a hundred miles of
treeless waste; even if we found a band of musk-ox,
we should be forced to come out again with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
dogs to haul in the robes, as our big canoe was
now too far back for us to think of carrying
any great weight with us. Although we had not
made a successful hunt, our trouble was not all
thrown away, as enough meat <i>caches</i> had been
made to insure us a fair chance of getting out
into the same country on the first deep snow.</p>

<p>Nobody liked to be the first to talk about turning
back, but on reaching the top of a low range
of hills and seeing a flat desolate stretch of country
lying to the north of us, with the lakes frozen
up and no sign of animals or firewood, King
turned to me and said: "It is not far from here
that the white men died from cold and starvation
at this time of year; let us go back before the
snow gets deep and we are not able to travel."
The old man looked particularly tough at this
moment; none of our faces were very clean, but
his was the more remarkable, as the blood of the
last caribou that we killed had splashed in it,
and, running down his beard, had mixed with
his frozen breath and appeared in the form of
long red icicles hanging from his chin. I think
he knew what was in my mind and had an idea
that I was laughing at him, for suddenly his
quick temper got the better of him and he broke
into one of those wild volleys of blasphemy that
I had heard him give way to so often, and, turning
on his heel, said that I could do as I liked,
but he was going to make the best of his way back
to the lodge. The walk back in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
wind was not nearly so bad as it had been coming
out head to it; and in many places we could travel
straight over the ice, and, by cutting across the
bays instead of walking round, save a considerable
distance. Whenever we got this chance we
put our loads on a handful of willow-brush and
dragged them after us, finding it far easier than
carrying them on our shoulders.</p>

<p>Another night we spent without fire on the
Point de Misère, and on October 3rd crossed the
Coppermine amidst running ice, and there abandoned
the little canoe. On the south side of the
river we fell in with the biggest band of caribou
we had yet seen, numbering fully three hundred;
but as we had no need of any more meat
<i>caches</i> on the Lac de Gras, we only killed enough
for present use.</p>

<p>This crossing of the Coppermine, by the way,
is an important spot in the history of the Dog-Ribs
and Yellow Knives. It has always been a
favourite swimming-place for the caribou, and
many a struggle took place for the possession of
this hunting-ground in the old days when there
was continual warfare between the two tribes.
At the present day it is a breach of etiquette for
any Indians to camp here, as it is supposed that
if the caribou are once headed back at this point
they will not come south of Mackay Lake. This
rule had evidently been broken lately, as we
found signs of a recent encampment, and King
considered that this amply accounted for our not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
finding the caribou before we reached the Lac du
Rocher.</p>

<p>After two more days' hard travelling we arrived
at our big canoe, and had the satisfaction
of finding some meat, that we had left there, untouched
by the wolverines; but the bay was
frozen solid, and there was no open water within
two miles. Beyond the points of the bay we
could see the white-capped waves running, but we
knew that at the first spell of calm weather the
whole lake would set fast.</p>

<p>I now saw an example of the readiness of
idea which King possessed in devising shifts and
expedients to get out of difficulties. Of course
he had had fifty years' experience in northern
travel, but he was certainly, in my opinion, far
above the average of the many other half-breeds
and Indians who had been my companions in
more or less difficult journeys in various parts
of Canada. Before I thoroughly understood
his scheme we commenced operations, by lashing
together all the poles and paddles into a
rough sort of ice-raft; on the top of this we
placed the loads that we had carried so many
miles, forming a smooth bed, two feet above
the level of the ice, on which to rest the canoe.
The bay had evidently frozen and broken up
once, and the second freezing had left a rough
surface; many of the floes were piled on top of
each other, while the rest had been turned on
edge, and it was necessary to keep the canoe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
clear of these sharp edges, which would have
ripped the tender birch-bark like a knife. One
man ran ahead, trying the strength of the ice
with an axe, while the others hauled on the raft,
and our method of progression was so satisfactory
that just before dark, after much ominous
cracking of the ice but no disaster, we camped
on the east point of the bay close to the edge of
open water. The half-breeds showed great
knowledge of ice, and, with an occasional tap of
the axe, picked out the safest route without making
a mistake.</p>

<p>The canoe propped on her side gave us the best
shelter we had had for many a night, and, finding
willows enough for a fire, we all felt jubilant
at the idea of reaching the first clump of
pines on the following day, besides getting an
opportunity to rest our feet, which by this time
were in a very bad condition. In this, however,
we were doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p>At the first sign of daylight we launched the
canoe, and, breaking our way out through the
young ice, were soon paddling in a heavy beam
sea, with every splash of water freezing on us,
and many stops to knock the ice from our paddles.
After two or three hours of this work the wind
died out, and, as we approached a group of small
islands that cut the lake up into numerous channels,
we saw a thin sheet of ice across the whole
width. All hope of passing with the canoe was
given up, and we headed for the south shore while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a heavy snowstorm made it difficult to keep the
course; the surface water was rapidly thickening
into ice, and the sharp needles began to scrape
unpleasantly along the sides of our frail vessel.
We were none too soon in reaching the land, and
had to carry the canoe over the thick ice near
the shore. Here we turned her over carefully,
and putting the poles, paddles, and all necessaries
underneath, abandoned her to be buried under the
snow till I might want her again the next summer.
Late in the following June we found her,
none the worse for her long exposure to the rigour
of a winter in the Barren Ground, but even
then there was no sign of open water in Mackay
Lake.</p>

<p>We had now to continue our journey on foot;
but by keeping to the shore of the lake, and sometimes
making use of the ice in crossing a bay,
we only camped twice before reaching the pine
timber. Late on the third day we came to the
bank of an ugly, quick-flowing stream, and saw
a large bunch of pines on the far side. Waist-deep
we made a ford among the running ice, and
were soon drying ourselves by a blazing fire of
pine-wood.</p>

<p>The whole of life is said to go by comparison,
and although a few pine-trees in a wilderness of
snow might seem the height of desolation to a
man lately used to the luxuries of the civilized
world, it appeared to us like a glimpse of heaven
after the exposure of the last few weeks. It really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
was a pleasant spot, and one which has impressed
itself on my memory more than any other camp
that we made during this trip. A band of caribou,
passing close by, provided us with supper,
while a big pack of ptarmigan held possession of
the little pine-trees, and kept up a constant expostulation
at the intrusion of the scarcely known
human beings. Hunger and danger were behind
us just at present, and we felt in the best of
tempers as we lay down for a long sleep on sweet-smelling
pine-brush.</p>

<p>Shortly after leaving camp in the morning another
band of caribou appeared, and, as the lodge
was now not far ahead, we killed about a dozen,
and put them in <i>cache</i> for later use. We then
walked steadily on all day, and in the evening
came in sight of Lake Camsell, over which the
sun was setting in full northern splendour, throwing
a wonderful purple light across the thin film
of ice that coated the water. It was late in the
night, and it was not till we had fired several
gun-shots at intervals, that we heard an answering
signal, and found that the women had set up
the lodge in the next bunch of pines, as they had
exhausted all the firewood close to the old camp.</p>

<p>Meat was abundant, for the caribou had been
passing, and many had been killed by the women
and boys. Bales of dried meat formed a solid
wall round the lodge, varied here and there by a
bladder of grease or a skin-bag full of pounded
meat, while bunches of tongues and back-fats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
were hanging from the cross-poles to smoke.
The scene reminded me of the old fairy stories
in which the hero used to discover houses, with
walls of sugar and roofs of gingerbread, full of
all the good things imaginable, while any member
of the Beaulieu family would make a respectable
ogre to guard such treasures. Of course
the lodge was dirty and infested with the vermin
from which these people are never free; but
there was an air of warmth and plenty about it
very agreeable after the hand-to-mouth existence
we had been leading.</p>

<p>On looking back at this expedition I cannot
help thinking that we were lucky in getting
through it without more trouble; it was just the
wrong time of year to be travelling, too late for
open water and too early for dogs to have been
of any service, even if we had had them with us.
One of the heavy snowstorms that, judging from
Sir John Franklin's experience, are common in
the end of September and beginning of October,
would have made the walking much more laborious,
as even the little snow that was on the
ground delayed us considerably. Another source
of danger was the numerous falls among the
broken rocks; but though we all came down heavily
at times, and, once or twice, with big loads
of meat on our backs, no damage was done.
The caribou kept turning up most opportunely,
and we had no real hardships from want of food.
Fuel was nearly always insufficient, but we only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
had two fireless camps, both on the Point de
Misère. In many places we used black moss in
addition to whatever willow scrub we could collect,
and so long as the weather was dry found
it quite good enough for boiling a kettle, but
when the snow fell it was perfectly useless. This
absence of a fire to sit by at night is the most
unpleasant feature in travelling the Barren
Ground.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>The day after our arrival was Sunday, a fine,
calm day with bright sunshine, of which we took
advantage to wash our scanty stock of clothing
and generally pull ourselves together. Cleanliness
of the body is not looked upon with much
favour by the half-breeds, but Sunday morning
was always celebrated in the lodge by the washing
of faces and a plentiful application of grease
to the hair. After this operation was over we
held a consultation as to the best way of carrying
on our hunt of the musk-ox, which had so
far not proved successful. The same old wrangling
and abuse of each other ensued, and finally
the following decision was arrived at. Paul and
François were to go back to Fond du Lac, so
soon as their feet were in a fit condition to travel;
they were to occupy themselves in getting ready
the dog-sleighs, and to return on the first deep
snow to the spot where we had killed the caribou
on the day that we reached the lodge. If any
of the Indians, of whom I had seen absolutely
nothing so far, were going to the musk-ox, arrangements
should be made with them to come
all together, so that we might have the benefit
of as many sleighs as possible to haul wood. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
our dried meat was to be put in <i>cache</i> at Lake
Camsell, and the camp moved to a clump of pines
that we had noticed the day before. King and
myself were to remain with the women, to kill
meat enough to enable us to start well supplied
for the musk-ox country.</p>

<p>We built a rough scaffold with the longest poles
obtainable, and stowed all the meat as high
above the ground as possible. Then we pulled
down the lodge, and, after a couple of days' walk
with heavy loads, camped on the south side of
a ridge, from the summit of which we had a
commanding view of Lake Mackay and the surrounding
country. There was little chance of
many caribou passing without being observed,
as there were usually several pairs of sharp eyes
on the look-out.</p>

<p>As this was to be our home for a month or
so, we took care to pick out a good spot and set
up the lodge in the most approved fashion, taking
advantage of the little shelter that the stunted
pines could afford.</p>

<p>A mile or two to the east lay the northern end
of a large sheet of water, running about forty
miles in a southerly direction, known to the Indians
as "The Lake of the Enemy," and formerly
the home of that terrible Evil Spirit supposed
to haunt the Barren Ground. It is hard
to get a full description of the Enemy, as, although
many people have seen it, they are at
once afflicted with insanity, and are incapable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
giving an accurate account of their experience;
but one must not dare to express unbelief in the
existence of the Enemy any more than in that of
the Giant Musk-Ox, fully ten times the size of
the biggest bull ever seen, whose track many Indians
say they have come across far out in the
Barren Ground.</p>

<p>King and myself spent most of our time prowling
about in search of caribou, but for the first
fortnight few came and we were only just able
to keep ourselves in fresh meat, although there
was soon plenty of dried meat from the animals
we had <i>cached</i> at this spot a week before. I now
saw what an advantage it is to take women on
a hunting-trip of this kind, and certainly King's
wife and daughter were both well up in the household
duties of the country. If we killed anything,
we only had to cut up and <i>cache</i> the meat,
and the women and small boys would carry it in.
On returning to camp we could throw ourselves
down on a pile of caribou skins and smoke our
pipes in comfort, but the women's work was never
finished. The rib bones have all to be picked out,
and the <i>plat côte</i> hung up in the smoke to dry;
the meat of haunches and shoulders must be cut
up in thin strips for the same purpose, and the
bones have to be collected, pounded down, and
boiled for the grease which is in such demand
during the cold weather about to commence. But
the greatest labour of all lies in dressing the
skins, cutting off the hair, scraping away every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
particle of flesh and fat, and afterwards tanning
them into soft leather for moccasins, which are
themselves no easy task to make. Many skins,
too, have to be made into parchment or carefully
cut into <i>babiche</i> for the lacing of snow-shoes,
and again, there are hair-coats to be made
for each member of the party. In an ordinary
Indian lodge the women have to put up with ill-usage
as well as hard work; but most of the
half-breeds know enough to treat them fairly;
and King, except in his moments of passion, when
he did not stop at any cruelty, treated his womenkind
very well.</p>

<p>One of our first expeditions was to hunt birch
for making the frames of snow-shoes, which
might be needed at any time, and King soon had
a pair ready for lacing; he was very clever with
the crooked knife, the universal tool of the North,
but the stunted birch is hard to bend to the proper
shape, and requires constant watching during
the process of warping.</p>

<p>The evenings were generally spent in long discussions
over our pipes, for tobacco was still
holding out, and the old man was keen to hear
about the doings of the white man in the Grand
Pays, as the half-breeds indefinitely term the
whole of the outside world. The ignorance existing
among these people is extraordinary, considering
how much time they spend at the forts,
and how many officers of the Hudson's Bay Company
they have a chance to talk to, besides the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
missionaries of both faiths. It is a different matter
with the Indians, as they seldom come to the
fort, and cannot hold much conversation with the
Whites without an interpreter. It was difficult,
for instance, to persuade King that the Hudson's
Bay Company does not rule the whole world, or
that there are countries that have no fur-bearing
animals, which in the North furnish the only
means of making a living for the poor man. He
was much interested in stories of the Queen, although
he could never believe that Her Majesty
held such a high rank as the Governor of the
Company, and quite refused to acknowledge her
as his sovereign. "No," he said; "she may be
your Queen, as she gives you everything you
want, good rifles and plenty of ammunition, and
you say that you eat flour at every meal in your
own country. If she were my Queen, surely she
would send me sometimes half a sack of flour, a
little tea, or perhaps a little sugar, and then I
should say she was indeed my Queen. As it is
I would rather believe Mr. Reid of Fort Province,
who told me once that the earth went round
and the sun stood still; but I myself have seen
the sun rise in the morning and set at night for
many years. It is wrong of you White Men,
who know how to read and write, to tell lies to
poor men who live by the muzzle of their guns."</p>

<p>Another matter over which his mind was
greatly exercised was the last North-West Rebellion
under Louis Riel. He was convinced that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
during this rising the half-breeds and Indians had
declared war upon the Hudson's Bay Company,
and gained a decisive victory besides much glorious
plunder; and he asked why such an outbreak
should not succeed on the Great Slave Lake,
where there was only one man in charge of a fort.
He had many questions too to ask about the various
good things that we eat and drink in England,
and criticised severely the habit of eating
three regular meals a day, which he described
as eating by the clock instead of by the stomach,
a much more greedy habit than that of gorging
when meat is plentiful and starving at other
times. On several occasions during our travels
together I had reason to expostulate with him on
the carelessness he displayed with provisions, but
without making the least impression. "What is
this improvidence?" he would say. "I do not
like that word. When we have meat why should
we not eat <i>plein ventre</i> to make up for the time
when we are sure to starve again?" He could
never realise that starvation might be partially
avoided by a little care.</p>

<p>Often King would spin me a long story as we
lay round the fire in the lodge; usually some tradition
handed down from the time when all the
animals and birds could converse together; what
the wolf said to the wolverine when they went on
a hunting-trip in company, and how the ptarmigan
invited the loon to dine with him in a clump
of willows in the Barren Ground, while there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
was a big stock of giant stories, with heroes much
resembling those of the favourite nursery tales of
one's childhood. Again he would come down to
more recent times and describe the battles of
the Dog-Ribs and Yellow Knives, which seem to
have been carried on in the same sneaking fashion
that has always distinguished the warfare
among the tribes of Canadian Indians; there was
no open fighting, and all the victories were won
by a successful approach on an unsuspecting and
usually sleeping encampment of the enemy, the
first grey of dawn being the favourite time of
attack.</p>

<p>The following story of the Deluge, as believed
by the Yellow Knives, I copied down from King's
recital; it appears to be a curious mixture of old
tradition with some details from the Biblical version
as taught to the Northern Indians on the
arrival of the first priests in the country.</p>

<p>Many years ago, so long ago in fact that as yet
no man had appeared in the country of the Slave
Lake, the animals, birds, and fishes lived in peace
and friendship, supporting themselves by the
abundant produce of the soil. But one winter the
snow fell far more heavily than usual; perpetual
darkness set in, and when the spring should have
come the snow, instead of melting away, grew
deeper and deeper. This state of affairs lasted
many months, and it became hard for the animals
to make a living; many died of want, and at last
it was decided in grand council to send a deputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to Heaven to enquire into the cause of the
strange events, and in this deputation every kind
of animal, bird, and fish was represented. They
seem to have had no difficulty in reaching the
sky, and passing through a trap-door into a land
of sunshine and plenty. Guarding the door stood
a deerskin lodge resembling the lodges now in
use among the Yellow Knives; it was the home
of the black bear, an animal then unknown on
the earth. The old bear had gone to a lake close
at hand to spear caribou from a canoe, but three
cubs were left in the lodge to take care of some
mysterious bundles that were hung up on the
cross-poles; the cubs refused to say what these
bundles contained and appeared very anxious for
the return of the old bear.</p>

<p>Now the idea of spearing caribou did not find
favour with the deputation from below, and as
the canoe was seen lying on the shore of the lake,
the mouse was despatched to gnaw through the
paddle, and as he had nearly accomplished this
feat the bear came running down in pursuit of a
band of caribou that had put off from the far
shore. When he was close up to his intended victims
and was working his best, the paddle suddenly
broke, the canoe capsized, and the bear
disappeared beneath the water. Then the animals,
birds, and fishes grew bold, and pulling
down the bundles, found that they contained the
sun, moon, and stars belonging to the earth; these
they threw down through the trap-door to lighten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the world and melt the snow, which by this time
covered the tops of the tallest pine-trees.</p>

<p>The descent from Heaven was not made without
some small accidents. The beaver split his
tail and the blood splashed over the lynx, so that
ever afterwards till the present day the beaver's
tail is flat and the lynx is spotted; the moose
flattened his nose, and many other casualties occurred
which account for the peculiarities of various
animals, and the little bears came tumbling
down with the rest.</p>

<p>And now the snow began to melt so quickly
that the earth was covered with water, but the
fish found for the first time that they could swim,
and carried their friends that could not on their
backs, while the ducks set to work to pull up
the land from beneath the water.</p>

<p>But it was still hard to make a living, so the
raven, then the most beautiful of birds, was sent
to see if he could find any place where dry land
was showing; but coming across the carcass of a
caribou he feasted upon it, although the raven
had never before eaten anything but berries and
the leaves of the willow. For this offence he was
transformed into the hideous bird that we know,
and to this day is despised of every living thing;
even omnivorous man will not eat of the raven's
flesh unless under pressure of starvation. The
ptarmigan was then sent out and returned bearing
in his beak a branch of willow as a message
of hope; in remembrance of this good action the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
ptarmigan turns white when the snow begins to
fall in the Barren Ground, and thus warns the
animals that winter is at hand.</p>

<p>But the old life had passed away and the peace
that had reigned among all living things was
disturbed. The fish, as the water subsided, found
that they could no longer live on the land, and
the birds took to flying long distances. Every
animal chose the country that suited it best, and
gradually the art of conversation was lost. About
this time too, in a vague and indefinite manner
about which tradition says little, the first human
being appeared on the shore of the Great Slave
Lake.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The weather continued fine without severe frost
till the middle of October, the snow was still light
on the ground, but the lakes all set fast. On the
night of the fourteenth a storm arose equal in
violence to a Dakota blizzard and continued till
the following evening, by which time there were
a couple of feet of snow on the ground. It was
impossible to keep the drift from coming into the
lodge, and as soon as the storm was over we had
to throw down our shelter and clear away the
banks that had accumulated inside. This was
distinctly the coming of winter and there was no
more sign of a thaw; the cold kept growing severer,
especially on clear days, but I had no thermometer
to mark its intensity. The daylight was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
shortening rapidly and the sun shone with little
warmth.</p>

</a><span class="caption"><br />The Indians Driving Caribou</span>
</div>

<p>With the increasing depth of snow there was
a noticeable migration of life from the Barren
Ground. Ptarmigan came literally in thousands,
while the tracks of wolves, wolverines, and Arctic
foxes made a continuous network in the snow.
Scattered bands of caribou were almost always
in sight from the top of the ridge behind the
camp, and increased in numbers till the morning
of October 20th, when little Baptiste, who had
gone for firewood, woke us up before daylight
with the cry of <i>La foule! La foule!</i> and even in
the lodge we could hear the curious clatter made
by a band of travelling caribou. <i>La foule</i> had
really come, and during its passage of six days
I was able to realise what an extraordinary number
of these animals still roam in the Barren
Ground. From the ridge we had a splendid view
of the migration; all the south side of Mackay
Lake was alive with moving beasts, while the ice
seemed to be dotted all over with black islands,
and still away on the north shore, with the aid
of the glasses, we could see them coming like
regiments on the march. In every direction we
could hear the grunting noise that the caribou
always make when travelling; the snow was
broken into broad roads, and I found it useless
to try to estimate the number that passed within
a few miles of our encampment. We were just
on the western edge of their passage, and afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
heard that a band of Dog-Ribs, hunting
some forty miles to the west, were at this very
time in the last straits of starvation, only saving
their lives by a hasty retreat into the woods,
where they were lucky enough to kill sufficient
meat to stave off disaster. This is a common
danger in the autumn, as the caribou coming in
from the Barren Ground join together in one
vast herd and do not scatter much till they reach
the thick timber. It turned out very well for us,
however, and there is really no limit to the number
we might have killed if we had been in need
of them; but it was too far out to make a permanent
winter's camp, and hauling such a long
distance with dogs is unsatisfactory, as most of
the meat would be consumed on the way. We
killed therefore only so many as we could use,
and had some luxurious living during the rest of
our stay in this camp. The caribou, as is usually
the case when they are in large numbers, were
very tame, and on several occasions I found myself
right in the middle of a band with a splendid
chance to pick out any that seemed in good condition.
The rutting season was just over, and as
the bulls had lost all their fat and their meat was
too strong to eat, only does were killed. A good
deal of experience is necessary to tell the fat ones,
but the half-breeds can tell age and sex pretty
well by the growth of the horns; often King told
me which to shoot at, and it was seldom that he
made a mistake in his choice.</p>

<p>This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> passage of the caribou is the most remarkable
thing that I have ever seen in the course of
many expeditions among the big game of America.
The buffalo were for the most part killed
out before my time, but, notwithstanding all the
tall stories that are told of their numbers, I cannot
believe that the herds on the prairie ever surpassed
in size <i>La foule</i> of the caribou.</p>

<p>Soon after the migration had passed, José
Beaulieu arrived from Fond du Lac in company
with an Indian, having made the journey on foot
in eight days. Things had apparently gone all
wrong there; they had been starving, and had of
course taken everything of mine that they could
lay hands on, both provisions and ammunition.
They had then quarrelled over the division of the
spoil, but as the caribou turned up within two
days of the house contentment was now reigning.
José had brought a little tea and tobacco,
of which we were now badly in need, and a long
string of grievances against his brothers at Fond
du Lac. He had done nothing to help me in any
way, although he had promised to have everything
ready for the first snow, and seemed rather
surprised that I did not take much interest in his
wrongs. He got even with me, however, on his
way back, by breaking into a <i>cache</i>, that I had
made before reaching the Lac du Rocher, and
stealing the tobacco that I was relying on for our
next trip in the Barren Ground.</p>

<p>José reported the woods to the south of us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
be full of caribou, and a big band of Yellow
Knives camped at the Lac de Mort, some of
whom were talking of coming for a musk-ox
hunt, if I could give them ammunition. I sent
word to the chief that I could supply three or
four of them, and ordered Paul and Michel to
come on with the dogs as soon as possible. The
snow was by this time quite deep enough for
travelling, and any delay meant an increased severity
in the weather, while in any case it would
be late in the year before we got back to Fond
du Lac.</p>

<p>After José left we relapsed into our lazy existence
of eating and sleeping, having no more excuse
for hunting; occasionally we made a short
trip on snow-shoes to examine some of our <i>caches</i>
and bring in a little meat, and once went for a
three days' expedition to our meat on the island
in Mackay Lake, and made a more secure <i>cache</i>
by putting the carcasses of the caribou under the
ice. At other times we amused ourselves by setting
snares for ptarmigan, which were in great
numbers, or by hauling a load of wood across a
small lake in front of the lodge, as we had used
up all the fuel within easy reach. On the shore
of this lake was a fine specimen of the balanced
rocks so common all over the open country; an
enormous boulder many tons in weight, so neatly
set on the three sharp points of an underlying
rock that it could be easily shaken but not dislodged;
the lake is known among the Indians as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the "Lake of the Hanging Rock." We might
have done some successful trapping for wolves,
wolverines, and foxes, but had unfortunately left
all our steel traps at Fond du Lac in order to
travel as lightly as possible in the portages.</p>

<p>Quickly and without incident the short days
slipped away until on the tenth of November, as I
was returning to camp, I heard a gunshot to the
southward of us. Instantly all was excitement,
and we had barely time to answer the signal before
a large party of men and eight dog-sleighs
came in sight over the ridge. At first I could
recognise no one, as the day had been very cold
and their faces were covered with hoar frost,
which makes it hard to distinguish one man from
another; but they turned out to be Paul, François,
and Michel, besides several Indians, among
whom was Zinto, the chief of the Yellow Knives,
who had come some hundred miles from his hunting-camp
on purpose to pay me a visit.</p>

<p>A small supply of tea and tobacco had come
up, but not nearly enough for our wants, and I
could see that we should have to do without these
luxuries just at the time when we most required
them; there was also a little flour, and we had
a big feast of flour and grease the same evening;
all the new arrivals came into the lodge, and sixteen
people and fully as many dogs slept inside
that night. After supper I handed round a small
plug of black tobacco to each man, as is the invariable
custom of the officer in charge of a fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
on the arrival of a band of Indians; and when
the pipes were lit Zinto gave me to understand
that he had a few remarks to make to me. He
would have been a fine-looking specimen of a
Yellow Knife but for a habit of blinking his eyes,
which gave him a rather owlish expression; he
was possessed with a great idea of a chief's importance,
but I found him a pretty good fellow
during the many dealings that I afterwards had
with him. King acted as interpreter, and I fancy
rather cut down the speech in length, but this was
the gist of it. "Zinto was very pleased to see a
white man on his hunting-ground. He had
known several at the forts, but had never before
seen one among the caribou. Many years ago his
father had told him stories of some white men
who had wandered across the Barren Ground and
reached the sea-coast; they had all endured much
hardship, and many had died from cold and starvation;
he did not know why they came to such a
country, when by all accounts they were so much
better off at home, but supposed there was some
good reason which an Indian could not understand.
For his own part he liked the Whites; all
that he valued came from their country, and he
had always been well treated by the Company.
He was willing to help me as much as he could
now that I had ventured so far into his hunting-ground,
but the musk-ox hunt in snow-time was
hard; only the bravest of his young men went,
and last year was the first time they had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the attempt. The Dog-Ribs who traded at Fort
Rae often went, but they had an easier country,
as the musk-ox were nearer the woods. There
would be much walking to do, and the cold would
be great; however, if I meant to go he would order
his young men to look after me, and on no
account to leave me if from starvation or any
other cause I could not keep up. I was to have
the first choice of the meat in the kettle and the
best place in the lodge to lie down. He hoped we
should have a successful hunt, and, although he
knew that we were short of such things, he could
not help asking for a little tea and tobacco to
give him courage for his journey back to the
camp. If he received this he should have a still
higher opinion of the white man and his heart
would be glad."</p>

<p>I replied that I was much gratified at seeing the
chief of the Yellow Knives in my camp, and was
sorry that I could not give him a more imposing
reception on the present occasion; I had heard
much to his credit from King Beaulieu and from
the Company's officer in charge of Athabasca district;
he was spoken of as a good chief and
friendly towards the Whites. I had come from
far across the big water on purpose to see the
country of the Yellow Knives, and was anxious
to know how they lived, and how they hunted the
various kinds of animals upon which they depended
for subsistence. For this purpose I now
proposed going for a musk-ox hunt, and was glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to see that some of his tribe were prepared to accompany
me. I could let them have enough ammunition
for the trip, and would share with them
the meat <i>caches</i> that we had made along our line
of travel, and also the tea and tobacco while it
lasted. Much interest was felt in my country
with regard to the Yellow Knives, and I hoped to
be able to give a good account of their treatment
to a stranger when I returned home. If his
young men behaved well while they were out with
me they should all receive presents when they
reached the fort.</p>

<p>Here the effect of my oration was rather spoilt
by the Beaulieus breaking in to ask what presents
they were to receive. Had they not been faithful
so long, and gone so much out of their way to
help me? and then the misery they had gone
through in the Barren Ground on the last musk-ox
hunt! Now followed a tremendous quarrel
among themselves, mostly, I believe, about the
stealing they had been doing at Fond du Lac, and
whether the value of the articles they had taken
should be deducted from the wages I had agreed
to pay them before starting. After the discordant
clamour had subsided a little, Zinto replied
that he was satisfied, and thanked me for the
small present of tea and tobacco which I could
not well refuse; we then discussed all the various
plans for the forthcoming hunt, and sat up feasting
till late in the night.</p>

<p>Something in the proceedings of the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
must have displeased King, as he suddenly astonished
us all by saying that he would not go with
us. What the grievance was I never found out,
but he was obstinate on the point. I had been
relying on him for interpreter, and was rather
annoyed at his refusal to go, especially as François,
the best French speaker in the outfit, declared
his intention of returning straight to Fond
du Lac. Michel too was wavering, but finally decided
to go, as Paul, who behaved very well on
this occasion, steadily declared that he was quite
willing to accompany me, and would carry out
the promise that he had made at Fort Resolution
to go the whole trip. These two then and myself,
together with the five Indians, Noel, William,
Peter, Saltatha, and Marlo (brother of Zinto),
and twenty-four dogs hauling six sleighs made
up the party that eventually started for the Barren
Ground about midday on Sunday, November
11th.</p>

<p>King maintained his ill-temper till the hour of
departure, saying that he did not want so many
men and dogs in his lodge eating up the provisions
that he had worked so hard to earn, and
that the sooner we started the better he would be
pleased. He used some particularly offensive
language to me, but relented at the last moment
and gave me his own hair-coat and a new pair of
snow-shoes, of which I was badly in want. He
also promised to do his best in the way of leaving
meat <i>caches</i> along the course that we should follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
on our return from the musk-ox country. I
was rather sorry to leave the old fellow after all,
as on the whole we had been pretty good friends
while we lived together, and he certainly had
great influence over the Indians which might
have been useful during our difficult journey.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>That night we made an open camp in a bunch
of pines on the south side of Lake Mackay, at
which point we intended to load wood for use in
the Barren Ground. We were much better found
in all respects than on the last occasion, and having
dogs with us should not be obliged to carry
anything ourselves. We used the ordinary travelling
sleighs of the North; two smooth pieces of
birch, some seven feet in length, with the front
ends curled completely over and joined together
with cross slats secured with <i>babiche</i> into a total
width of sixteen inches. A ground-lashing is
passed along through holes in the outside edge of
the sleigh, and to this is fastened a rough deerskin
wrapper in which the load is stowed as neatly
as possible and the wrapper laced on the top, so
that in case of a capsize, which frequently happens,
nothing can fall out. The traces are hitched
on to loops in the front end of the sleigh, and
four dogs put in the caribou-skin harness one in
front of the other. The company officers have
imported leather dog-harness with buckles for
their own use between the forts; but I think for
handling in really cold weather the caribou-skin,
or better still moose-skin, with thongs instead of
buckles, is preferable.</p>

<p>Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> twenty-four dogs rejoiced in endless varieties
of names, English, French, and Indian,
some popular names introduced by the Whites being
freely given without reference to sex or colour.
For instance, in my own sleigh the fore-goer,
a big yellow bitch, answered to the name of
Napoleon, whilst just behind her came a black
bushy-tailed dog La Reine; we had three Drap
Fins, from their resemblance to the fine black
cloth so dearly beloved by the half-breeds and Indians,
two Chocolates of different colours, besides
Cavour, Chandelle, Diable, Lion, Blucher,
Royal, Bismarck, and a host of unpronounceable
Indian names.</p>

<p>We were all dressed alike in coats of caribou-skin
with the hair outside and hoods fastened
up closely under the chin, and these we hardly
took off day or night for the five weeks that we
were out. Our hands were thrust into moose-skin
mittens lined with duffel and hung round
the neck by highly ornamented plaited woollen
strings, or in the case of a man of little wealth
with a more humble piece of <i>babiche</i>, but most of
my companions managed to show a little colour
in this respect. We rolled our feet in duffel and
cased them in huge moccasins, of which we all
had two or three pair; and as we were very careful
in drying them every night before sleeping
to get rid of all dampness caused by perspiration
there was not a single case of frozen feet during
the whole journey, although the big cold of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Arctic winter had now fairly set in. We used
small snow-shoes about three feet in length, as
most of the travelling would be on the frozen
lakes where the snow is always drifting, and, consequently,
pretty hard. One man, or in case of
softer snow two, went ahead to break the road
and the dogs followed in their tracks, or, if they
showed any disinclination to start, were most unmercifully
clubbed and cursed by name till they
did so.</p>

<p>A big deer-skin lodge and a sufficient number
of carefully trimmed poles had been brought up
from Fond du Lac, as it would have been impossible
to endure the cold and almost perpetual
wind without shelter of any kind, but they had
the disadvantage of greatly increasing the weight
of our load. King had given us a little dried
meat, but only enough for a couple of days for
such a large outfit; the dogs alone required at
least fifty pounds a day to keep them in good condition.
We had the meat <i>caches</i> ahead, and hoped
to fall in with the musk-ox before we ran out of
provisions entirely. The danger of course lay in
not finding these animals when we got far out, as
the caribou had almost all passed into the woods
and we could not hope to see any after the first
few days. Our ammunition was rather limited,
but with care we had enough to keep the muzzle-loading
weapons supplied, and Paul and myself
had a fair amount of cartridges for our Winchester
rifles. We were obliged to wrap deer-skins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
round the levers and the parts of the barrel that
our hands touched to avoid contact with the iron,
which sticks to the bare skin in cold weather and
causes a painful burn.</p>

<p>The next day was spent in cutting wood into
short lengths and loading it on to the sleighs. In
the morning Marlo was very ill from the surfeit
of flour he had had in King's camp, but was well
enough to travel a short distance in the afternoon,
and we pitched our lodge in the snow, clear of all
timber. Here I had my first experience of a winter
camp in the Barren Ground.</p>

<p>A spot being chosen where the snow is light
and the ground clear of rocks, a ring of the requisite
size is marked out. Snow-shoes are taken
off and used as shovels for throwing away the
snow from the inside of this ring, making a
wall varying in height according to the depth of
snowfall. Outside this circle the sleighs are
turned on edge, the poles planted behind them,
and the deer-skin lodge spread round, forming as
comfortable a camp as can be expected in such a
country. The wood allowed for supper is carefully
split and a fire lighted, the kettle hanging
over it from three small sticks carried for the
purpose; the lumps of meat for dog's food are
spread round the fire till sufficiently thawed, when
a lively scene commences outside the lodge, every
man feeding his own dogs and watching them to
see there is no foul play. By the time this is over
the melted snow in the kettle is boiling, and every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
man gets his piece of meat in much the same
manner as the dogs. I always had the privilege
of first choice, but in the dense clouds of smoke
that usually filled the lodge it was by no means
easy to take the full advantage of it. We drank
tea while it held out, and then fell back on the
greasy snow-water that the meat was boiled in.
There was always a good proportion of caribou
hair in everything we ate or drank, varying afterwards
to the coarse black hair of the musk-ox,
which was far more objectionable.</p>

</div>

<p>As soon as supper was over and our moccasins
dry the fire was allowed to go out, to economize
wood, and each man rolled himself up in his
blanket, lay down on the frozen ground, and
slept as well as he might till it was time to travel
again. Directly all was quiet the dogs forced
their way in and commenced a free fight over us
for any scraps or bones they could find lying
about; finally they curled themselves up for the
night without paying much attention to our comfort.
A warm dog is not a bad thing to lie against
or to put at your feet, but these hauling dogs
seem to prefer to lie right on top of your body,
and as most of them are a considerable weight
a good night's rest is an impossibility. Any attempt
to kick or shove them off produced a general
row, and a moving foot was often mistaken
in the darkness for a hostile dog and treated as
such; Paul received one rather bad bite on his
toes, but the rest of us all got off with slight nips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
We had to be careful to put everything edible, in
the way of moccasins, mittens, and even snow-shoes,
under us, as these are things that few dogs
can resist, and there is nothing more annoying
than to find all the <i>babiche</i> eaten out of your
snow-shoes in the morning. When the hungry
time came later on the dogs began to eat the
lodge, and would soon have left us houseless but
for one man always keeping watch at night.</p>

<p>One is accustomed to hear of men sleeping in
fluffy woollen bags in the Arctic regions, but I
found that a deer-skin coat and one blanket were
sufficient to keep me warm except on the very
coldest nights. I had told Michel particularly to
bring another blanket that I had left behind at
Fond du Lac, and abused him roundly when I
found he had come without it. It seems that an
Indian had arrived at the house with a load of
dried meat and grease, and was in want of a
blanket; Michel, to use his own expression, took
pity on him and gave him my blanket in exchange
for the grease. He doubtless considered
this a pious act of charity, but had rather spoilt it
by consuming the grease himself; and on my
asking him why, if he felt so sorry for the Indian,
he had not given him one of his own blankets,
or at least kept the grease for me, he replied:
"I have only two blankets and I have a wife; you
have no wife, so one blanket is enough for you;
besides, I love grease, and it is hard for me to
see it and not eat it."</p>

<p>In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> the middle of the night Saltatha, always the
earliest, got up and drove out the dogs, lit the
fire, and prepared another meal, exactly similar
to our supper of the evening. Usually we harnessed
up many hours before daylight and travelled,
with only an occasional ten-minutes' rest,
till the sun had been long down and there was
just enough daylight left to make camp; dinner
was completely cut out of our day as being too
heavy a strain on our firewood. There was no
attempt at washing made by any of the party
during the whole time that we were out, and indeed
it would have been an impossibility, as our
small fires were only just sufficient to melt the
snow for cooking purposes.</p>

<p>In clear weather the nights were of wonderful
brilliancy, and after we had been out a
couple of weeks the moon was big enough to add
a little light, and of course kept steadily improving
in this respect; but the starlight alone
illumined the waste of snow sufficiently to see
landmarks far ahead. Generally the Aurora was
flashing in its full glory, and if there was no wind
the travelling was pleasant enough. At the first
sign of dawn, and thence till the sun rose, the
cold always became more severe, and if a light
head-wind happened to get up at the same time
there were sure to be some frozen noses and
chins in the outfit. The hair on our faces, even
to the eyebrows and eyelashes, was always
coated with rime, giving everybody a peculiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
stupid expression; my beard was usually a mass
of ice, and I had great difficulty in thawing it
out by our small fires, although it proved a grand
protection from frost-bite. I think I was the
only one that escaped being bitten in the chin, but
my nose, cheeks, and forehead were touched several
times.</p>

<p>The sunrise was often very beautiful, and the
effects of long duration, as the sun is close to the
horizon a considerable time before he shows
above it, while the dense blue blackness in the
north and west gives the impression that the
night is still lingering there. Often a sun-dog
is the first thing to appear, and more or less of
these attendants accompany the sun during his
short stay above the horizon. The driving snow,
which obliterates everything in blowing weather,
often spoils the evening effects; but once or
twice I saw the sun set over a frozen lake, tinting
the snow with various shades of red, and
throwing a beauty over the wilderness that it is
useless for me to attempt to describe.</p>

<p>A thick fog hung over everything during the
whole of the second day out from the woods,
and of course made it extremely difficult to find
the meat <i>cache</i> in Lake Mackay; at dark we
camped on the first land that we came to, but
had no very accurate idea of our position. Luckily
the weather cleared towards morning, and
we made out the island on which we had stored
the carcasses of the caribou killed on September<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
22nd. We had some trouble in punching a hole
with our only ice-chisel and hauling out a solid
lump of meat and ice some five feet thick and
many feet in circumference; but the Indians
were much cheered at the sight of so much provision,
and declared themselves ready to go out
to the sea-coast if necessary. The short day
was nearly over by the time we had got the meat,
so we camped for the night on the island; but
before daylight we were off again, and when
the sun set had nearly reached the end of the lake
and made a wood <i>cache</i> on a conspicuous point
for our return journey. The next day was thick
again, and we were lucky in finding the bay in
which we had left the big canoe during our last
expedition. A very curious thing, illustrating
the difficulty of recognising objects in these fogs,
happened just as we were leaving the ice. We
saw an animal, apparently at some distance,
bounding along the horizon at a most remarkable
pace; all down the line there were cries of <i>Erjerer</i>
(musk-ox), <i>Et-then, Le loup!</i> guns were
snatched from the sleighs, and even the dogs
charged at a gallop in pursuit of the strange animal.
After a rush of ten yards the quarry disappeared;
the first man had put his foot on it,
and it turned out to be one of the small mice so
common in the Barren Ground. What it was
doing out on the lake at this time of year, instead
of being comfortably curled up under
ground, I cannot say; but it certainly gave me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the impression that if these fogs continued we
should run a good chance of coming to grief
through losing our way.</p>

<p>At sunrise the weather cleared, and we found
a small band of caribou at the beginning of the
twenty-mile portage to the Lac de Gras. After
we had killed three and fed the dogs, we began
our overland work. The snow was much softer
here, with many large rocks showing through,
and some steep hills made travelling hard for
the dogs. Night caught us about half-way between
the two lakes, and the north wind freshened
up into a tempest such as I have never seen
surpassed by the blizzards of the western prairies.
Fortunately we found a fairly sheltered place for
the lodge or it must have been swept away; as
it was the deer-skin flapped with a noise like that
of a sail blown to pieces at sea; two of our lodge-poles
were carried away, and we were in momentary
expectation of being left without shelter
to the mercy of the storm; the driving snow
forced itself in, and men and dogs were only
recognisable by the white mounds which marked
their position. For thirty hours we lay like this
till the wind abated at midnight, when we started
again towards the north, and continued walking
till we had crossed the big bay of the Lac de
Gras into which the Coppermine River runs. We
camped a little short of our second meat <i>cache</i>
on the Point de Misère, and on the following day,
although the fog had settled down again, Paul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
by a very good piece of piloting, discovered the
small lake in which we had <i>cached</i> the meat. We
were getting pretty hard up again by this time,
and the Indians, with the exception of Saltatha
whose good spirits never failed, were showing
signs of sulkiness. This new supply, however,
gave them fresh courage, and we were all confident
of finding the musk-ox before we got to
the end of the six caribou that we picked up
here. We experienced the same difficulty in
breaking the ice, and as we spent much valuable
time in getting out the meat, made but a poor
day's journey. On the following day we passed
the most northerly point that we had reached in
the autumn, and were now pushing on into a
country that none of us had ever seen before.</p>

<p>At the spot where we had left the Lac de Gras
we had noticed a few small willow sticks showing
above the snow, which afterwards proved very
useful. Following a small stream we reached
another large lake, stretching in a north-easterly
direction, and camped at the far end of it in a
heavy snowstorm that had been going on all day.
During this time we were keeping a sharp look-out
for musk-ox; but we could find no tracks, and
as the weather continued thick had no opportunity
of seeing animals at a distance. Two more
days we travelled on in this manner, making
long journeys with our meat nearly finished and
our wood-supply growing rapidly less; for there
had been more delay, from various reasons, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
we had anticipated, and we had been careful to
avoid <i>caching</i> wood for our return journey as we
might be unable to follow the same course. The
shape of the hills here changes in a most distinct
manner. The usual undulations give way to
sharp scattered buttes, composed of sand and taking
very remarkable forms, a solitary conical
mound being a common feature in the scenery.
Small lakes were still numerous, and for a considerable
distance we followed a large stream,
evidently one of the head waters of the Coppermine,
here running in a south-east direction.</p>

<p>On November 20th we dropped on to a lake
some twelve miles in breadth, and crossed to the
north shore in falling snow. We had been on
short rations, men and dogs, for some time, and
our last mouthful was eaten for supper this night.
When we made camp a few miles beyond the lake
the outlook therefore was by no means cheerful.
The continual thick weather spoilt our chance of
finding the musk-ox, and we were now too far
away from the woods to have much chance of
reaching them without meat. Of course we could
always have eaten the dogs, but then we should
have been unable to haul our wood, which in the
Barren Ground is almost as necessary as food.
As we felt certain that we were well in the musk-ox
country we decided to spend the next day in
hunting at all risks, and by good luck the morning
broke clear and calm. Michel and myself
remained in camp to look after the dogs, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
had now become so ravenous that they required
constant watching to keep them from eating the
lodge, harness, and everything else that they
could get at. The others went in couples in different
directions with the agreement that if anyone
discovered a band of musk-ox they should
return at once to wait for the rest of the party
to come in, when we were all to start with the
dogs in pursuit. There was no breakfast, and
all the hunters were off before daylight, evidently
fully aware that the success of our expedition, if
not our chance of supporting life, was centred in
the result of the day's proceedings; and it was
certainly a great relief when Paul and Noel appeared
towards mid-day and reported a large band
of musk-ox undisturbed a short distance to the
north. Peter and Marlo returned soon afterwards,
having found another band in a more
westerly direction. I distributed a pipeful of the
now very precious tobacco, while we waited for
William and Saltatha, and discussed the plan of
attack. I was rather surprised at Noel's asking
Paul to tell me that I might have some of the
musk-ox, as he was pleased at receiving the tobacco.
I was about to reply that I had come far,
and been to a great deal of trouble, on purpose to
kill some of these animals, and I should think it
rather extraordinary if I were not allowed to do
so, when Paul explained that it was a custom
among the Yellow Knives to consider a band of
musk-ox as the property of the discoverer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
only his personal friends were granted the privilege
of killing them without payment of some
kind. Sometimes an Indian would go through
all the hardships of a hunt, and then have to give
up nearly all his robes because he had not been
lucky enough to discover a band and was out of
favour with his more fortunate companions; so
I told Noel I was very grateful for his kindness,
and made him believe himself a remarkably good
Indian. By this time it was getting late, and as
the wind had risen the snow was beginning to
drift. There was much grumbling at the delay,
and in spite of my remonstrances at breaking
up our agreement to wait for William and
Saltatha, the dogs were harnessed, the lodge
pulled down, and the sleighs loaded. I pointed
out that the snow was drifting badly and that
the other two would not be able to follow our
tracks; but was told that it was only white men
who were stupid in the snow, so I made no
further objection. After travelling about three
miles through some rough hills, we caught an
indistinct view of the musk-ox, fully a hundred
in number, standing on a side-hill from which
most of the snow had drifted away; and then
followed a wonderful scene such as I believe no
white man has ever looked on before. I noticed
the Indians throwing off their mitten-strings,
and on enquiring the reason I was told
that the musk-ox would often charge at a bright
colour, particularly red; this story must, I think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
have originated from the Whites in connection
with the old red-rag theory, and been applied by
the Indians to the musk-ox. I refused to part
with my strings, as they are useful in keeping
the mittens from falling in the snow when the
hand is taken out to shoot, but I was given a wide
berth while the hunt was going on. Everybody
started at a run, but the dogs, which had been
let out of harness, were ahead of us, and the
first thing that I made out clearly through the
driving snow was a dense black mass galloping
right at us; the band had proved too big for the
dogs to hold, and most of the musk-ox had
broken away. I do not think they knew anything
about men or had the least intention of charging
us, but they passed within ten yards, and so
frightened my companions that I was the only
man to fire at them, rolling over a couple. The
dogs, however, were still holding a small lot at
bay, and these we slaughtered without any more
trouble than killing cattle in a yard. There is
an idea prevalent in the North that on these occasions
the old musk-ox form into a regular
square, with the young in the centre for better
protection against the dogs, which they imagine
to be wolves; but on the two occasions when I
saw a band held in this manner, the animals
were standing in a confused mass, shifting their
position to make a short run at a too impetuous
dog, and with the young ones as often as not in
the front of the line. There was some rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
reckless shooting going on, and I was glad to
leave the scene of slaughter with Marlo in pursuit
of stragglers. Marlo, in common with the
other Indians, had a great horror of musk-ox at
close quarters, and I was much amused at seeing
him stand off at seventy yards and miss an animal
which a broken back had rendered incapable
of rising. He said afterwards that the musk-ox
were not like other animals; they were very cunning,
could understand what a man was saying
and play many tricks to deceive him; it was not
safe to go too near, and he would never allow me
to walk up within a few yards to put in a finishing
shot. After killing off the cripples, we started
back to the place where we had left the sleighs,
and, night having added its darkness to the drifting
snow, we had the greatest difficulty in finding
camp. Marlo confessed he was lost, and we were
thinking what it was best to do for the night
when we heard the ring of an axe with which
somebody was splitting wood in the lodge; the
others, with the exception of William and Saltatha,
were all in, but there seemed little chance
of these two reaching camp that night. We had
eaten nothing for a long time, so we celebrated
our success with a big feast of meat, while the
dogs helped themselves from the twenty carcasses
that were lying about. They gave us very
little trouble in the lodge, as we saw nothing of
them till we skinned the musk-ox next day, when
two or three round white heaps of snow would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
uncurl themselves on the lee-side of a half-eaten
body. I questioned the Indians about the two
missing men, and they were unanimous that unless
the night got colder they were in no danger
of freezing to death; they were sorry that they
had not waited, and would go at the first sign
of daylight to see if they were in the old camp.
Peter and Noel accordingly started very early in
the morning, and found the men lying close together
under the snow at the old camp; they had
returned at dark, and as our tracks had drifted up
there was not the least chance of finding us.
They were slightly frost-bitten in the face and
hands, but as soon as they had got over their first
numbness were able to walk to camp, where they
soon forgot their natural indignation at the mean
trick we had played them in the joys of warmth
and food. We were obliged to be a little extravagant
in our wood to make up for the hard times
of the night before, and Saltatha soon recovered
his liveliness; he was far away the best Indian
that I met in the North, always cheerful and
ready for work, and afterwards, in the summer,
the only one of the Yellow Knives brave enough
to volunteer for an expedition down the Great
Fish River. A hard life he leads, always in poverty,
a butt and a servant to all the other Indians,
who are immeasurably his inferiors for any useful
purpose. Although a capital hunter, they
swindle him out of everything he makes, and
take the utmost advantage of the little fellow's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
good-nature; he seems to have no sense in this
respect, and will jump readily at any bargain that
is offered him. He is just the man for an expedition
in the Barren Ground, as when once he
has given his word to go he can be relied upon
to carry out his promise, which is more than I
can say for the rest of his tribe, who only wait
to rebel and desert till a time when they think
you can least do without them.</p>

<p>We spent most of the day in skinning the
musk-ox, which, by the way, is not a pleasant
undertaking in cold weather; the skin is naturally
hard to get off, and on this occasion the carcasses
had grown cold during the night, and the
difficulty was greater than usual. The robes
were in splendid condition; the undergrowth,
which resembles a sheep's fleece and is shed in
summer, was now thick and firm, while the long
permanent hair had obtained the black glossiness
distinctive of a prime fur. We cut up all the
meat that the dogs had left us, and loading it on
the sleighs with the robes, moved camp about
five miles to the west to be ready to go in search
of the other band which Peter and Marlo had
discovered. We calculated that we should be
able to haul forty-five robes, besides meat enough
for our journey, back to the woods, and at present
we had only half a load.</p>

<p>While the men were planting the lodge I
climbed to the top of a high butte to have a look
at the surrounding country; the hill was so steep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
that I had to take off my snow-shoes to struggle
to the summit, and was rewarded for my trouble
by a good view of probably the most complete
desolation that exists upon the face of the earth.
There is nothing striking or grand in the scenery,
no big mountains or waterfalls, but a monotonous
snow-covered waste, without tree or scrub,
rarely trodden by the foot of the wandering Indian.
A deathly stillness hangs over all, and the
oppressive loneliness weighs upon the spectator
till he is glad to shout aloud to break the awful
spell of solitude. Such is the land of the musk-ox
in snowtime; here this strange animal finds
abundance of its favourite lichens, and defies
the cold that has driven every other living thing
to the woods for shelter.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>Early on the following morning we left camp
with the light sleighs, and at sunrise were close
to the place where the second band had been
discovered. We were a long time in finding them,
as the fog had settled down again, but at last
made out a band of sixty on a high ridge between
two small lakes in a very easy place to
approach. Directly after we sighted them Paul's
sleigh, which was ahead, capsized over a rock,
and his rifle, which was lashed on the top of it,
exploded with a loud report. The bullet must
have passed close to some of us, as on examination
the rifle appeared to be bearing right down
the line, and it was lucky that nobody was killed
or crippled; a wounded man would have had little
chance of getting back to the woods alive. The
musk-ox took not the slightest notice of the report,
although we were within a couple of hundred
yards of them, and we soon had eighteen
rounded up, the main body breaking away as they
had done before. A sickening slaughter, without
the least pretence of sport to recommend it, now
took place till the last one was killed, and we
were busy skinning till dark.</p>

<p>I took some of the best heads, but most of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
were afterwards thrown away by the Indians to
lighten the load on the sleighs. The animals
that we killed in this band were of various ages,
and it was interesting to note the growth of the
horns in different specimens. They begin in both
sexes with a plain straight shoot, exactly like
the horns of a domestic calf, and it is then impossible
to tell the male from the female by the
head alone. In the second year they begin to
broaden out, and the bull's horns become much
whiter and project straighter from the head than
the cow's, which are beginning already to show
the downward bend. At the end of the third
year the cow's horns are fully developed, and I
do not think they grow much after that age;
with the bulls, however, the horns are only just
beginning to spread out at the base, and it is not
till the sixth year that the solid boss extends right
across the forehead, the point of junction being
marked by a slight crack into which the skin has
been squeezed during the growth of the horns.
A curious fact is noticeable in the horns of the
young bulls before the boss has begun to form;
they are quite soft and porous at the base, and
can easily be cut with a knife; when once the
boss has grown, the horn is as hard as a rock.
I made careful inquiries of the Indians on these
points, and they told me that, except in the case
of very young or very old animals, they could always
tell the age of the musk-ox by a glance at
their horns.</p>

<p>We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> had the greatest difficulty in finding our
way back to the lodge, and it was late before we
turned in, everybody agreeing that we had done
enough, and ought to make our best way back to
the timber before our firewood was exhausted.
The loads would be quite as heavy as they had
been coming out, for we now had the weight of
robes and meat to make up for the wood we had
used. We had, roughly, three hundred and fifty
miles to travel to reach Fond du Lac, but intended
to take the last part of the journey easily
after we fell in with the caribou. I should like
to have known our exact position on the map,
and the distance from the sea-coast at Bathurst
Inlet, but of course had no chance of making
even an approximate calculation; the Indians had
no local knowledge, as they were entirely beyond
any country they knew. Our only luxuries, tea
and tobacco, were now finished, and I found that
the want of tobacco was the most trying hardship
on the whole trip: one pipeful as you roll
up in your blanket for the night imparts a certain
amount of comfort, and makes you take a more
cheerful view of life; but when even this cannot
be obtained there is a perpetual craving for a
smoke, and the best of tempers is liable to suffer
from the deprivation. After we had boiled our
last handful of tea-leaves three times over, Saltatha
ate them with great gusto, and in future
we drank the water in which the meat was boiled.
I did not miss the tea nearly so much as the tobacco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and soon began to like the hot greasy
<i>bouillon</i> well enough to struggle for my full
share.</p>

<p>We were late off next morning, and could not
make a good day's journey, as the snow was soft
till we got on the large lake, and we were further
delayed in the evening by finding another band of
musk-ox. The Indians said they could carry half
a dozen robes more, and insisted, against my
wishes, on killing this number; the consequence
was that we had to camp for the night, and the
dogs were more overloaded than ever; they were
able, however, to eat to their hearts' content, and
there was very little left of the six musk-ox in
the morning. Two long days' travel took us back
to the point on the Lac de Gras where we had
seen the willows above the snow, and as the dogs
were showing signs of fatigue and their feet were
much cut about by the sharp snow-needles sticking
between their toes, we decided on taking a
day's rest. We managed to pull up enough small
willows to keep a bit of a fire going most of the
day, and if we had had tobacco should all have
enjoyed ourselves immensely. It was a bright
clear day, without wind and terribly cold. I
climbed to the top of a hill in the afternoon to
see if I could make out the west end of the lake,
but an intervening hill made it impossible to get
a clear view, and I could form no idea of its
length. On this day I felt the top of my tongue
cold in breathing, and my companions, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
well accustomed to low temperatures, all remarked
the extreme severity of the cold.</p>

<p>It must have been about midnight when I
heard Saltatha splitting wood, and the well-known
cry of <i>Ho lève, lève, il faut partir!</i> Looking
out of my blanket I felt the snow falling in
my face through a big hole that the dogs had
eaten in the lodge, and said that it was no use
moving, as we should never be able to find our
way across the broad traverse that lay ahead.
I was laughed at as usual, and after a breakfast
of boiled meat we started out into the darkness.
I soon saw there was little chance of picking up
the skin of the musk-ox that we had <i>cached</i> in
September, as, although the intention was to follow
the shore of the lake till we came to the
<i>cache</i>, we lost sight of land immediately with absolutely
nothing to guide us on our course. There
was no wind, and such a thick downfall of snow
that matters did not improve much when the
blackness turned into grey with daylight.</p>

<p>I have often heard it stated that the gift of
finding their way is given to Indians under all
conditions by a sort of instinct that the white
man does not possess, but I never saw children
more hopelessly lost than these men accustomed
all their lives to Barren Ground travel. I have
seen it happen to half-breeds and Indians many
times, and have come to the conclusion that no
man without a compass can keep his course in
falling snow, unless there is wind to guide him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
It is always advisable to put ashore at once, or,
better still, not to leave your camp in the morning,
as then you know your point of departure
on the first signs of a break in the weather. On
this occasion the usual thing happened; we
walked all day, changing our roadbreaker every
hour or so, while the men behind shouted contrary
directions when they thought he was off
his course. Luckily we found land just at dark,
and camped immediately. A great discussion ensued
as to our position, and opinions varied
greatly about the direction of the north star; but
we could do nothing till the weather improved,
and even then, unless it grew very clear, or the
sun came out, we might not know which course
to take, as landmarks are few and far between.
Fuel could not last more than three nights with
the strictest economy.</p>

<p>The wind rose in the evening, and the snow
ceased falling, but began to drift heavily. In the
night there was a tremendous uproar. I was
awakened by hearing the universal Indian chant
(<i>Hi hi he, Ho hi he</i>), and much clapping of
hands, while the dogs were howling dismally far
out on the ice, evidently thinking they were meant
to hunt something, but disappointed at not being
able to find anything to tear to pieces. I looked
out to see what was going on, and found everybody
sitting in the snow shouting; Saltatha had
discovered a single star, and the noise I had heard
was the applause supposed to bring out one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
principal constellations, so that we might get an
idea of our direction. The heavens certainly did
clear, and when daylight broke and the wind
moderated we made out our position easily
enough. In fourteen hours' walk we had come
perhaps five miles straight, having made a huge
circle to the right and fallen on an island close
to the shore that we had left in the morning.
There was still the whole width of the lake to
cross, but when we camped late in the portage
between the two big lakes I thought we had got
out of the scrape very well. There was no apparent
reason why the snowstorm should have
stopped, and a continuation of it must have
brought us serious trouble.</p>

<p>The next day was worse than ever. A gale
from the south in our teeth and drifting snow
made it cruel work to face the storm; but we had
to go, as fuel was rapidly vanishing, and we had
already burnt some of our lodge-poles, and we
hoped to reach a small wood-<i>cache</i> that night.
We could find the way, as we had the wind to
guide us; but the snow was soft, and the dogs
were hardly able now to drag the sleighs over the
rough hills; one of the poorest froze in harness
and had to be abandoned. Our blankets, which
we usually wrapped round our head and shoulders
when facing the wind, now came in for dog-cloths,
and certainly saved some more of the
dogs from being disabled by frost-bite; but as
the snow melted between their backs and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
blankets, the latter got wet and afterwards froze
till they would stand like a board, and were then
a most uncomfortable form of bedding. The
slow pace at which we were forced to travel
made it much worse, and we all found our faces
slightly frozen. At dark we camped nearly at
the end of the portage, although we did not know
it till morning, and reluctantly cut up another
couple of lodge-poles for firewood, besides a
small box in which I had been carrying my journal
and ammunition.</p>

<p>The wind lightened during the night, and backing
into the east came fair on Lake Mackay. We
found our wood-<i>cache</i> all right, and set out on
the sixty-mile walk that still lay between us and
the first pine-timber. The travelling on the lake
was better than in the portage, and well on in
the night we put ashore on the island where we
had stored our first meat during the autumn
musk-ox hunt. The dogs were too tired to go
any further without rest, or we should have
pushed on all night. Our last lodge-pole was
burnt to cook a kettleful of meat for breakfast
on December 1st, and before daylight we were
off, with no thought of camping till we could
make fire. The sun at this time only stayed
above the horizon for a couple of hours, and had
sunk beneath the snow before we made out far
ahead the high ridge under which the first clump
of pines lay. We were badly scattered along the
track, and some of the dogs, and the men too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
for that matter, had great difficulty in keeping
up pace enough to make the blood circulate; it
was six hours later, and we were all pretty well
used up, when we saw the little pines standing out
against the sky line.</p>

<p>What a glorious camp we had that night! The
bright glare of two big fires lit up the snow-laden
branches of the dwarf pines till they glittered like
so many Christmas-trees; overhead the full moon
shone down on us, and every star glowed like a
lamp hung in the sky; at times the Northern
Lights would flash out, but the brilliancy of the
moon seemed too strong for even this wondrous
fire to rival. It was pleasant to lie once again
on the yielding pine-brush instead of the hard
snow, and to stretch our legs at full length as we
could never stretch them in the lodge; pleasant,
too, to look back at the long struggle we had gone
through, and to contrast our present condition
with that of the last month. Our experiences
had been hard and not without their share of
danger, and we could now congratulate ourselves
on having brought our hunt to a most satisfactory
conclusion. I had fully succeeded in carrying
out the object of my expedition, and could
look forward to a period of ever-increasing comfort,
culminating in the luxury of life at a Hudson's
Bay Fort within a few weeks. I had intended
to winter at the edge of the Barren
Ground, but was forced to give up the idea, as
I had seen too much of the Beaulieus to care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
about living any longer with them. The fact
that meat was scarce again did not trouble me,
as I was by this time accustomed to empty larders
and had fallen into the happy Indian method
of trusting that something would turn up; besides,
we were pretty sure to run across the caribou
within the next few days. The want of tobacco
was the worst grievance that I had, but
the prospect of obtaining this was getting
brighter after each day's travel.</p>

<p>Very late at night Saltatha turned up with a
badly frozen nose and chin. One of his dogs
had given out and been abandoned, and he had
been pushing the sleigh for many hours; he had
almost given up trying to bring in his load when
he saw the blaze of the fires far off and his courage
came back. The sun was up before anyone
turned out, but the dogs were better for the rest,
and a short day took us into a big bunch of pines
on King Lake, within an easy day of a small
meat <i>cache</i> that I had made while we were
camped at the Lake of the Enemy. I had my
doubts about finding the place, as none of the
others knew where it was, but was lucky enough
to hit it off; and we took out the meat of two
caribou, after breaking an axe to pieces in our
endeavours to chop away the ice which had
formed between the rocks from the melting of
the snow during a warm spell in the beginning
of October.</p>

<p>The same night we camped at the scaffold on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
which we had stored all the dried meat that the
women had made while we were away on the
first musk-ox hunt. King was to have taken
most of it, leaving us sufficient for a couple of
days' supply, and a note in the syllabic characters
introduced into the North by the priests informed
us that he had kept his promise. There were
plenty of signs that he had done so; but the
wolverines had been before us, and a few shreds
of meat lying at the foot of the stage told
the story plainly enough. This was rather a disappointment,
and matters looked worse when we
had travelled the whole length of Lake Camsell
at our best speed. Here again we expected to
find a <i>cache</i>, as some meat had been left when
we killed the first caribou in the autumn, but the
wolverines had taken it. This is a common incident
in Northern travel, but never fails to draw
forth hearty execrations on the head of the hated
<i>carcajou</i>.</p>

<p>There was much talk of abandoning loads and
making a rush to reach the caribou or a Yellow
Knife encampment which was supposed to lie
some distance ahead of us; but I opposed this
scheme strongly, and for once managed to get
my own way. The weather was fine, and we
cared little for the cold, as we could always
make a fire in case of freezing. Without eating
much we pushed on rapidly for two days, crossing
the Lac du Rocher, the scene of our starvation
in September, and finally on the third morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
found a band of caribou, of which we killed
enough to relieve all immediate anxiety. By this
time we were among thick timber and following
closely our canoe-route of three months ago.</p>

<p>In the early hours of December 7th we came to
a line of pine-brush planted across a small lake,
and soon afterwards fell on the tracks of fresh
snow-shoes; before daylight, at the end of a long
portage over a thickly wooded hill, we dropped
into an encampment of a dozen lodges. It turned
to be Zinto's camp, and all my Indians found
their wives and families awaiting them here.
There were great rejoicings over our arrival,
as we had been so long on the hunt that a good
deal of anxiety was felt for the safety of husbands
and brothers. Zinto invited me into his
lodge, gave me a feast of pounded meat and
grease, a cup of tea, and, better still, a small plug
of black tobacco; this seemed too good to leave,
and as we had travelled many hours in the night
I decided to spend the rest of the day here.</p>

<p>The camp was very prettily situated on a small
flat a few feet above the edge of a frozen lake;
and when the sun rose over the hill, lighting up
the brown deer-skin lodges with their columns of
blue smoke rising straight up in the frosty air,
the snow-laden pine-trees, and the silver-barked
birches, the whole scene seemed a realization of
one of Fenimore Cooper's descriptions of an Indian
camp in winter.</p>

<p>Much talking had to be got through, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
story of our musk-ox hunt was told many times
over. I was the object of great interest, and
was closely questioned as to my experiences in
the Barren Ground and the contrast between life
there and in my own country. After Zinto had
satisfied himself on these points he broached more
abstruse subjects, insisting on knowing my opinion
with regard to the differences of the Protestant
and Roman Catholic faiths, and seeming
pleased to hear that he was by no means the first
man who had found this point hard to fully understand.
Many other things there were about which
he desired information; but I am afraid some of
my answers conveyed little meaning to him, as I
was myself rather hazy about many of the topics
of conversation, and had only Michel, who was
the worst Frenchman of all, for interpreter, Paul
having gone off to see his wife who was camped
a few miles to the east. But when Zinto got on
to trading he was quite at home, and before leaving
I had to give him an order for many beaver-skins
(the medium of trade in the North), to be
paid at Fort Resolution. He was very good in
providing me with everything I wanted for my
journey, and gave me a new pair of snow-shoes
and a sleigh, besides lending a dog to replace one
that had fallen lame; meat he was short of, but
he had heard that the Beaulieus had been killing
caribou, so that I was likely to find <i>caches</i> by the
way; a track was broken to Fond du Lac, and we
ought to get there easily in three days. Zinto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
thought the Great Slave Lake would be entirely
frozen over and fit to travel on by this time, as
lately the sky had been clear in the south; when
there is any open water a perpetual mist rises
from it and lies like a huge fog-bank over the
lake.</p>

<p>A happy indolent life the Yellow Knives lead
when the caribou are thick on their pleasant hunting-ground
round the shores of the Great Slave
Lake, and most of the hard times that they have
to put up with are due to their own improvidence.
This is their great failing; they will not look
ahead or make preparation for the time when the
caribou are scarce, preferring to live from hand
to mouth, and too lazy to bother their heads about
the future. They are rather a fine race of men,
above the average of the Canadian Indian, and,
as they have had little chance of mixing with the
Whites, have maintained their characteristic manners
till this day; they are probably little changed
since the time when the Hudson's Bay Company
first established a trading-post on the Big Lake a
hundred years ago. When the priests came into
the country the Yellow Knives readily embraced
the Roman Catholic religion, and are very particular
in observing all the outward signs of that
faith, but I doubt if their profession of Christianity
has done much to improve their character.
They are a curious mixture of good and bad, simplicity
and cunning; with no very great knowledge
of common honesty, thoroughly untrustworthy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and possessed with an insatiable greed
for anything that takes their fancy, but with no
word in their language to express thanks or gratitude.
To a white man they are humility itself,
looking upon him, by their own account, as their
father, and so considering him bound to provide
them with everything they want, even to his last
pair of trowsers or pipeful of tobacco; refuse
them anything when you are dependent upon their
services on a journey, and they will leave you in
the woods; for their own part, if they have ammunition
they are always at home. In another
way they are generous enough, and take great
pride in showing hospitality. Go into one of their
lodges, and a blanket is spread for you in the seat
of honour farthest away from the flap that does
duty for a door; a meal is instantly provided, no
matter if it takes the last piece of meat in the
camp, and the precious tea and tobacco are offered
you in lavish quantities. The Yellow Knives are
a timid, peaceable race, shrinking from bloodshed
and deeds of violence, and it is seldom that quarrels
between the men got beyond wrestling and
hair-pulling. The women are, as a rule, not quite
so hideous as the squaws of the Blackfeet and
Crees; they are lax in morals, and accustomed to
being treated more as slaves than wives in the
civilized interpretation of the word. They do all
the hard work of the camp, besides carrying the
heaviest loads on the march; and in too many
cases are rewarded with the worst of the meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and the blows of an over-exacting husband. Early
marriages are fashionable, as a man is useless
without a wife to dry his meat and make moccasins
for him. The great object of a Yellow
Knife beauty is to secure a good hunter for a
husband; the man who can shoot straight, and is
known to be skilful in approaching the caribou,
is always a prize in the matrimonial market and
need have little fear of a refusal, especially as the
husband is supposed to hunt for his father-in-law
after marriage, and the old man will use all his
influence to arrange the match. Superstition still
reigns supreme among these people; any mischance
is put down to "bad medicine," and reasons
are always forthcoming to account for its
presence. There are several miracle-workers and
foreseers of the future in the tribe, who are said
to perform very wonderful things, but I found
them extremely shy of showing off their accomplishments
when I asked for an exhibition. Like
all other Indians who live the wild life that they
were intended to live, the Yellow Knives are dirty
to the last degree. They are careful about combing
and greasing their hair, and are lavish in the
use of soap, if they can get it, for face and hands,
but their bodies are a sanctuary for the disgusting
vermin that always infest them; they seem to
have no idea of getting rid of these objectionable
insects, but talk about its being a good or bad
season for them in the same way that they speak
of mosquitos.</p>

<p>From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> every point of view, then, the Indian of
the Great Slave Lake is not a pleasant companion,
nor a man to be relied upon in case of emergency.
Nobody has yet discovered the right way to manage
him. His mind runs on different principles
from that of a white man, and till the science of
thought-reading is much more fully developed,
the working of his brain will always be a mystery
to the fur-trader and traveller.</p>

<p>At sunrise the following morning I left Zinto's
camp, with Michel and Marlo, bound for Fond
du Lac, all the other musk-ox hunters going back
to domestic happiness. The weather was still
bright and cold, and the days perceptibly longer
as we travelled south. We were again short of
meat, as all the Indians were in the same plight,
and although we saw a band of caribou shortly
after starting, we were unable to get a shot at
them. Towards evening we found a small <i>cache</i>
of meat hung in a tree, and knowing that it must
belong to some of the Beaulieus I had no compunction
in taking it. Here we left our canoe-route,
and passing to the westward of the Lac de
Mort headed straight for the house at Fond du
Lac. The woods were well grown and signs of
life abundant; the tracks of wolves, wolverines,
foxes, and an occasional marten, frequently
crossed the road, and ptarmigan were continually
flying up under the leader's feet. Here, too, I
saw again my old friend the Whisky Jack, as he
is called throughout the North, a grey and white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
bird the size of a thrush, with a most confiding
disposition and an inordinate love of fat meat; he
sits on the nearest tree while the camp is being
made, comes in boldly, inspects the larder, and
helps himself with very little fear of man. If it
is a starving camp he chortles in contempt and
flies away, having a very low opinion of people
who travel without provisions; but if meat be
plentiful he spends the night there, and comes in
for rich pickings in the morning when the camp
is struck. This bird is common throughout the
wilder parts of Canada, and has acquired many
names in different places; in the mountains of
British Columbia he is the Hudson's Bay bird or
grease bird, and far away to the East the moose
bird, caribou bird, Rupert's bird, and camp-robber.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the second day we met
the Indian Etitchula, who had left the fort with
us in August and had been hanging on more or
less to our party ever since. He was on his way
back to King Beaulieu's Camp, two days' travel
to the north-east, having made a trip to Fond du
Lac to make a raid on my tea and tobacco, and
see if there was any news of us, as King was
greatly alarmed at our prolonged absence. We
relieved him of a little tea, but he had not been
able to get any tobacco out of François, who had
roundly asserted that it all belonged to him; he
also gave us a couple of whitefish, which proved
a very acceptable change from our long course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
straight meat. Late the same evening we made
our last camp on the high land close to the edge
of the mountains within five miles of the house;
we could easily have got in that night, but I much
preferred a quiet camp under the stars to the company
of the gang of Beaulieus who were sure to
be at Fond du Lac.</p>

<p>One word of caution against using the compressed
tea imported by the Hudson's Bay Company
into the North as a substitute for tobacco;
it is very good to drink, but if you smoke it you
pay the penalty by a most painful irritation in the
throat, which is made worse by breathing the intensely
cold air. We all tried it that night, and
all swore never to do so again, although I have
often smoked the ordinary uncompressed tea
without disastrous results and with a certain
amount of satisfaction.</p>

<p>We were off in good time on the morning of
December 10th, and were soon sitting on the
sleighs, rushing down the steep incline, with frequent
spills from bumping against trees; this was
the only piece of riding I had during the whole
five weeks' travel. The first signs of the <i>petit
jour</i> were just showing as we pulled up at the
house, and François quickly produced the tobacco
he had refused Etitchula. I think for a few minutes
they were really glad to see us back safe,
but soon the old complaints began. Times had
been hard, although the women and children all
looked fat enough to belie this statement; José<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
had been catching whitefish, but had refused to
give any to François; while the latter, according
to José, had been very mean in distribution of
my effects, eating flour every day himself but giving
none away. They had gone through nearly
everything between them, and moreover did not
seem the least bit ashamed of their conduct. As
my dogs were all used up, I decided to leave them
here, and made arrangements with François to
bring his own train on to the fort with me. It
seemed that notwithstanding the hard times he
had sufficient meat and fish stored away for our
trip, and there were still a few pounds of flour left,
so that we should live in luxury all the way in.</p>

<p>I spent the day shooting a few ptarmigan, indulging
in much tobacco, and listening to the petitions
of the various ill-used members of the family.
José was particularly amusing; he had been
the most useless man of the lot, never even venturing
into the Barren Ground, but spending most
of his time at Fond du Lac, shooting away my
ammunition and playing havoc with tea and tobacco,
besides robbing the <i>cache</i> at the Lac du
Rocher. Now he was full of love for me, and
gave me a list of things that he wanted in addition
to his wages, as a reward for all that he had
done and was ready to do for me. Among other
items, he wanted my rifle and hunting-glasses,
and remarked that my Paradox gun, which had
been lying here all the time, would be very useful
for him at the goose-hunt in the following spring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Fortunately none of the Beaulieus know how to
put together a breech-loading gun, so the Paradox
and its ammunition had been left in peace to
do me good service in the summer. I think the
Paradox is the most useful gun yet invented for
purposes of exploration, as it does away with the
necessity of carrying a separate weapon for shot
and ball, and shoots very true with either; but
there seems no reason why the patent should not
be applied to a 20-bore. For procuring food in
a really rough country, where a man has to carry
his own ammunition, the ball-cartridges for a 12-bore
are needlessly heavy, and the charge of shot
is too great for the close range shooting which is
usually done on these occasions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>At Fond du Lac I slept for the first time since
we left the fort under a roof, but on account of
the awful squalor of the house I should have
much preferred the usual open camp in the snow.
Daylight found us under way again, François and
myself, with a small boy to run ahead of the
dogs; as we were travelling light I expected to
be able to ride the last half of the journey, but
for the first two days the fish for dogs' food made
our load too heavy to travel at a fast pace. I
left all the musk-ox and caribou heads and skins
that I had managed to save, to come in with
Michel and Marlo when they made the usual
journey to the fort for New Year's day, on which
occasion the Indians from all quarters bring in
their furs to trade, and receive a small feast of
flour and sugar, an event not to be missed on any
account, even though wives and families may be
left to starve in the woods and the famished
dogs drop with fatigue along the track.</p>

<p>There was no news as to the state of the ice, as
we were the first people to attempt the crossing of
the lake this winter. It is usually not safe for
travel till the middle of December, so we coasted
along the north shore, increasing the distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
but getting greater safety by doing so. We took
things easily, making early starts and putting
ashore frequently for a cup of tea; it was a
great improvement on the canoe-travelling which
had delayed us so much in the autumn. At sundown
every night we picked out a sheltered spot
among the tall pine-trees where firewood was
plentiful, threw away the snow with our snow-shoes,
and put down a thick mat of pine-brush;
then a huge fire was lit and enough wood cut for
the night, the fish thawed for the dogs, and supper
cooked for the men. We had bread at every
meal, which is in itself a luxury after four
months of straight meat; the day ended with tobacco,
and we rolled ourselves in our blankets
to sleep, till the position of the Great Bear told
us it was time to be on the march once more.
People who live in civilization find it hard to believe
that men in these northern latitudes habitually
sleep out under the stars, with the thermometer
standing at 30°, 40°, and even 60° below
zero; yet it is those same people of civilization
who suffer from colds in the head, lung-diseases,
and a variety of ailments unknown to the <i>voyageur</i>,
whose only dangers are starvation and the
risk of accidents incidental to travelling in rough
countries.</p>

<p>On the second day we passed a couple of houses
occupied by an Indian, Capot Blanc, with whom
I afterwards became great friends; he had left
for the fort a couple of days before, but the ice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
was reported to be dangerous in the Grand Traverse.
Another Indian, Thomas, a brother of
Marlo and Zinto, was ready to start, and joined in
with us for the rest of the journey; he had only
two dogs, but with a light load managed to keep
up easily enough. The ice among the islands
was pretty good, but the snow was soft and deep,
and it was not till our fourth night out from
Fond du Lac that we camped on the last outlying
island, ready to take the Traverse. About eighteen
miles away to the south, without any chance
to put ashore till we reached it, lay the Ile de
Pierre, and we were to make for a half-breed's
house that lay within a mile of it on the main
shore of the lake. It had been arranged that I
was to ride in pomp across this piece, so, after a
good breakfast about three o'clock, I turned into
the sleigh and soon dropped off to sleep to the
music of sleigh-bells and a volley of French oaths
with which François encouraged his dogs every
few minutes. At this time the stars were shining
brightly, and there was not a breath of wind. I
must have slept for a couple of hours when François
awoke me with the information that we
were lost. Turning out of my warm berth I
found a gale of wind blowing, with snow falling
and drifting heavily; I could hardly make out the
men in the darkness, though they were all standing
within a few yards of me. Of course I had
not the slightest idea where we were, or the direction
in which we had been travelling. François<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
seemed undecided, but Thomas was quite
sure that by keeping the wind abeam we should
hit off the Ile de Pierre. We put him ahead,
and he proved perfectly right in his direction;
for after four hours' steady walk we made out
the land, the weather clearing a little at day-break.
We had headed a little too far to the west,
but were soon inside the half-breed's cabin, where
we found plenty of fish for the dogs, and so decided
to spend the day there, as the wind had
freshened up again and the drifting snow made
travelling unpleasant. We did not know what a
narrow escape we had had till the owner of the
house came in, after making an attempt to visit
his nets. He reported the ice broken up to the
west by the violence of the gale, and had we kept
a little more in that direction we might easily
have walked into open water in the darkness and
made a disastrous ending to our expedition.</p>

<p>Our course the next day lay over shoal water,
mostly inside sandbanks and through narrow
channels of the delta of the Slave River. We
crossed the main stream on good ice, and following
the shore of the lake for ten miles, rattled
into the fort about two o'clock, within ten minutes
of the arrival of the outward-bound packet from
Mackenzie River. Luckily enough it had been
delayed one day by the storm that had overtaken
us in the Grand Traverse, and I had an opportunity
of sending out letters by the dog-sleigh that
was to leave the same night. For true hospitality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
there is nothing in the world to beat the welcome
back to a Hudson's Bay post in the North after
one has made a long journey in the wilds; no
need to trouble your head with the idea that you
may not be wanted, or that you will eat too much
of the ever insufficient supplies sent in from the
outside world to the officer in charge. Why is it
that the less a man has, and the harder things
are to obtain, the more ready he is to divide?
It does not seem to work in civilization, but it is
certainly so in rough countries, and especially
with the Hudson's Bay Company's officers in the
Far North. Perhaps it is because they have all
seen hardships and privations in the Company's
service and know the value of a helping hand
given in the time of need; men who have suffered
themselves have always more feeling for the sufferings
of others than people who have lived only
on the soft side of life.</p>

<p>I don't think I ever enjoyed a meal so much as
that first dinner at Fort Resolution, after a most
necessary wash. A year later I dragged myself
into a small trading-post at the foot of the Rocky
Mountains after many days' total starvation, but
had then got beyond the capacity of enjoying anything.
On the present occasion I was able to
thoroughly appreciate the change from my four
months' experience in the Barren Ground. How
strange it seemed once more to sit at a table, on a
chair, like a white man, and eat white man's food
with a knife and fork, after the long course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
squatting in the filth of a smoky lodge, rending a
piece of half-raw meat snatched from the dirty
kettle. Then, too, I could speak again in my own
language, and there was a warm room to sit in,
books to read, and all the ordinary comforts of
life, with the knowledge that so long as I stayed
in the house I had my own place, while the wind
and the snow had theirs outside.</p>

<p>There was no scarcity at the fort this year, although
the autumn fishing had not been successful.
The Fond du Lac boat had brought in a
good supply of dried meat, and there was a better
stock of flour than is usually to be found at a
northern fort. Mr. Mackinlay, too, had got in a
fair supply of luxuries from Winnipeg, and, as
Mrs. Mackinlay was an excellent manager, we always
lived as well as one should wish to live
anywhere.</p>

<p>Fort Resolution is a fair sample of a trading-post
in the North. It is situated on the south side
of a bay, the entrance to which is sheltered by a
group of islands, the largest known as Mission
Island, from the Roman Catholic mission established
there in charge of Father Dupire. The
original site was on an outlying island known as
Moose Island, but the present position on the
mainland has been found more practicable. The
buildings consist of the master's house, a comfortable
log-building flanked on each side by a
large store, one used for provisions and the
other as a fur and trading store; these were originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
within a stockade and formed the fort
proper, but the peaceful nature of the Indians
has removed all need for defensive works. Outside
is a small row of log-houses, occupied by the
engaged servants, freemen, and a couple of pensioners
too old to make their living in the woods.
Close at hand are the buildings belonging to the
Protestant Mission, while the willows and bush-growth
of a densely-wooded level country hem in
the small patch of cleared ground on which the
settlement stands; here potatoes and a few other
vegetables are raised, and in a favourable season
produce very fair crops. There are a yoke of
work-cattle for hauling wood and a couple of
milch cows are kept, as hay is easily procured
in the numerous swamps which are scattered
through the woods in every direction. The only
high land to be seen is a conspicuous bluff marking
the entrance to the Little Buffalo River some
ten miles along the lake shore, this stream heads
in to the south, and as it breaks up earlier in the
spring than the Little Slave River it is used at
that time of year as a route to Fort Smith, one
overland portage being made, to drop on to the
main stream a short distance below the fort.</p>

<p>Looking out over the vast expanse of frozen
lake on still, bright days some very beautiful and
curious mirage effects can often be seen. Everything
takes an unnatural and frequently inverted
form; islands so far away as to be below the
horizon are seen suspended in the air, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
impossible to recognise a point or bunch of trees
with which you are perfectly familiar in ordinary
circumstances.</p>

<p>There are four engaged servants at the fort; a
white man, Murdo Mackay, native of the Hebrides,
who was serving a five years' contract
with the Company, and three half-breeds, by far
the best of whom was Michel Mandeville, who
has held the position of interpreter at Fort Resolution
for several years. Except at the time of
the Fall fishery, an engaged servant's work is
light&mdash;cutting and hauling enough firewood to
keep the fort supplied, visiting the nets and lines,
and an occasional trip with the packet, or to get
trading-goods from another fort.</p>

<p>Christmas passed away quietly, but there was
stir enough when the Indians came in for New
Year and the trading began. The old system of
barter is still carried on, with the beaver-skin
for a standard. An Indian's pile of fur is
counted, and he is told how many skins' worth of
goods he has to receive; then he is taken into the
store and the door solemnly locked, as it is found
impossible to trade at all with more than one at
a time. It seems very simple; the Indian knows
exactly how many skins he has to take, and the
value in skins of every common article. But, to
begin with, he wants everything he sees, and the
whole stock would hardly satisfy him, and it is a
long time, with many changes of opinion, before
he has spent the proceeds of his hunt. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
arises the question of his debt, and he tries to
take the largest amount possible on credit for his
spring hunt; the trader cannot refuse absolutely
to make any advances, as there are some things
essentially necessary to the Indian's life in the
woods, but the debts are kept in proportion to the
man's character. After he has finished his trade,
he shows his purchases to his friends, and, acting
on their advice, usually comes back to effect
some change, and the game begins all over again;
sometimes a whole day is passed in laying out a
hundred skins, roughly fifty dollars according to
our method of calculation. Before the Indian
leaves the fort he always comes in and does a
little begging while saying good-bye to his master.</p>

<p>I had a very bad time of it settling up with
the Beaulieus. Promises that I had made under
stress of circumstances had to be redeemed, but
it was hopeless to try and satisfy them; although
they had each received far more than had been
originally agreed upon, they continued grumbling
till they left the fort. On New Year's day a big
ball was given to the half-breeds, while the Indians
were provided with the materials for a
feast, and held a dance of their own in one of
the empty houses. It was the poorest display
imaginable; many of the Canadian tribes have
really effective dancing, but the Yellow Knives
appear to have a very elementary idea of graceful
movement. Their only figure is to waddle round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in a circle, holding each other's hands, keeping up
a monotonous chant, and spitting freely into the
middle of the ring. In the big house Red River
jigs and reels were kept up with unflagging energy
till daylight.</p>

<p>As soon as everything had quieted down and
the Indians had gone back to their hunting-ground,
Mackinlay and myself started on an expedition
after the caribou to try and kill some
fresh meat for the fort. We took Michel, the
interpreter, with us, and Pierre Beaulieu, a
brother of King's; and a resident of Mission
Island joined us with his two sons, as there was
news of the caribou being at no great distance on
the far side of the lake. It was now the dead of
winter, the season of the <i>gra' frète</i>, and we had
two remarkably cold days' travel to reach the
north shore of the Great Slave Lake. We struck
into the woods, not far to the eastward of the
Gros Cap, the point forming the eastern extremity
of the long narrow arm leading to Fort Rae.
We each had a sleigh of dogs, and were able to
ride most of the time on a good road broken by
a band of Indians hunting in the neighbourhood.
Two long days over small lakes and through the
thick pine woods, in a country much resembling
that of Fond du Lac but of lower elevation,
brought us among the caribou, but they were
not in very large numbers.</p>

<p>We had everything we could want to make life
pleasant in the woods, abundance of tea and tobacco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
meat if we killed it, and no hardships; the
cold was severe of course, but there was plenty
of firewood, and it was our own fault if we could
not keep ourselves warm. Three days we spent
in hunting, and, although we did not kill very
much, there was a little meat to take back; we
never really found the caribou in any quantity, or
we should have made a big killing and <i>cached</i> the
meat, to be hauled later on when the days grew
longer. A rattling three days' journey took us
back to the fort, as old Pierre, who is one of the
most rushing travellers I ever met, hustled us
along to save using his meat on the way home;
he had no intention of feeding his dogs from his
load for more than two nights when he had fish
to give them at home. This trouble about dogs'
food is the great drawback to winter travelling
in the North; a dog, to keep him in good order,
requires two whitefish, weighing each perhaps
three pounds, every night. This adds so much
to the load that a ten days' journey is about the
longest one can undertake with full rations all
round, unless it be in a part of the country where
game is plentiful or fish can be caught <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>After the caribou hunt, we amused ourselves
about the fort; sometimes going in search of
ptarmigan, which are usually to be found among
the willows close to the edge of the lake; and
sometimes paying Father Dupire a visit on his
island, a couple of miles away, to hear some of
his interesting experiences during a residence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
many years among the Indians. Close at hand
lay the Protestant Mission, where there was always
a welcome, and, with these attractions and
a fair supply of books, time did not hang at all
heavily till early in February the winter packet
from the outside world arrived. I received a big
bundle of letters, the first that reached me since
June, but it happened that none of the newspapers
for the fort turned up, and we were left in
ignorance of what had happened in the Grand
Pays.</p>

<p>So many travellers have written about this
great Northern Packet and the wonderful journey
that it makes that it is unnecessary for me to say
much about it. On its arrival at Fort Resolution
it presents the appearance of an ordinary dog-sleigh,
with a man ahead of the dogs, which are
driven by a half-breed, with plenty of ribbons
and beads on leggings and moccasins, capable of
running his forty miles a day with ease, and possessed
of a full command of the more expressive
part of the French language.</p>

<p>Dr. Mackay, who was on his yearly round of
visits to inspect the outlying posts in his district,
came down from Fort Chipeweyan with the packet,
and we had a long talk respecting a summer
trip to the Barren Ground which I proposed making.</p>

<p>My intention was to leave the fort on the last
ice in the spring and travel with the dogs to the
spot where we had left our big canoe in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
autumn, there to await the breaking up of the
lakes and to descend the Great Fish River with
the first open water. I had no special object in
reaching the sea-coast, as a birch-bark canoe is
not the right sort of craft for work among salt-water
ice; and it was more to see what the Barren
Ground was like in summer, and to notice the
habits of the birds and animals, than for the sake
of geographical discovery, that I wished to make
the expedition.</p>

<p>The Great Fish River has been twice descended
before, but of course both Back's and Anderson's
parties were compelled by the shortness of the
summers to confine their exploration to the immediate
neighbourhood of the river; and I
thought that, by spending more time at the head-waters
than they had been able to do, I should
get a good idea of the nature of the country and
an insight into the Indian summer life among the
caribou. The difficulty was to obtain a crew; but
Dr. Mackay very kindly consented to Mackinlay's
accompanying me, and also lent me the two engaged
servants, Murdo Mackay and Moise Mandeville,
brother of Michel Mandeville the interpreter,
but not half such a good fellow. We
hoped to be able to engage the services of some
of the Indians to guide us to the head of the
river, but they have such a dread of the Esquimaux,
who hunt farther down the stream, that
we hardly expected any of the Yellow Knives to
accompany us beyond that point. Long ago there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
was always war between the Indians and the Esquimaux,
and Hearne's description of the massacre
at the Bloody Falls on the Coppermine gives
a good idea of the hatred that existed between
these tribes. For many years they have not met,
and although the Esquimaux seen by Anderson
on the Great Fish River appear peaceful enough,
the Yellow Knives hunting at the head of the
river are in constant fear of meeting them.</p>

<p>Zinto, the chief, and another Indian, Syene,
arrived at the fort soon after Dr. Mackay left,
and we consulted them as to the best route to
follow, and whether we could depend upon their
tribe for any help. They told us that there was
no difficulty in reaching the head-waters of the
river, as the Indians were in the habit of coming
there every summer, but beyond was an unknown
country; they both remembered Anderson's expedition,
and were full of stories about the difficulties
of navigation, the numerous portages and
the likelihood of starvation, but knew nothing
from personal experience. We failed lamentably
in the attempt to discover when the ice in the
river usually broke up. Syene told us that it was
in the moon when the dogs lie on their backs in
the sun, and Zinto volunteered the information
that it was soon after the leaves begin to shoot
on the little willows in the Barren Ground; but
we could not work it out into any particular
month. Both promised to make dried meat and
pemmican for us if they fell in with the caribou,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and to leave <i>caches</i> in the last bunch of pine-trees.
Next day they left for their camp, two hundred
miles away in the woods, to await the first signs
of warmer weather to start for the spring musk-ox
hunt. Zinto was to come to the fort about the
1st of May, and personally conduct us to the
places where he had piled up the meat of many
caribou for our use.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>About the middle of February, 1890, little
François, an Indian living at the mouth of Buffalo
River, arrived with the news that during a
hunting-trip he had made to the southward he
had seen the tracks of a band of wood buffalo
and intended to go in pursuit of them after this
visit to the fort.</p>

<p>Mackinlay and myself both wanted an excuse
to be in the woods again, and the next day saw us
plodding across the bay on snow-shoes to the
comfortable little shanty, under the high bluff,
which forms the most conspicuous landmark
within sight of Fort Resolution. The establishment
was presided over by an old lady, formerly
cook at one of the forts, and kept with a cleanliness
not always to be found in a white man's
dwelling. The following morning we started
with two sleigh-loads of fish for the dogs and
provisions and blankets for ourselves. François
brought his wife and little girl, besides a rather
crazy boy, given to epileptic fits, but a good worker
in the intervals between his attacks. We followed
the river for a mile or two, then turned
into the woods on the west bank, and, crossing a
lake of some size, headed in a south-west direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
through the thick pine-forest, occasionally
picking up a marten from a line of traps set by
little François, for we were following the track
that he had made on his last trip, or finding a
rabbit hung by the neck in one of his wife's
snares; very cunning these old women are in all
things concerning the stomach, and if there are
many rabbit-tracks to be seen in the snow there
is little danger of going without supper.</p>

<p>On the second day we crossed a large prairie
dotted with lakes, formerly the home of many
beavers, and still bearing evidence of their labours
in the long banks which served as dams and
the huge mounds which were once their houses.
The beavers have all gone long ago, and the
ladies who wore the pretty fur-trimmed jackets
in far-away England, and the husbands who
grumbled at their price, are gone too; but the
beavers have left the most impression on the face
of the earth. Wonderful moulders of geography
they are; a stream dammed up in a level country
forms a huge lake where the forest stood, the
trees fall as their roots rot in standing water,
and, if the dam be not attended to by the workers,
a fertile grass-covered prairie takes the place
of the lake. From the Liard River and Great
Slave Lake, to the Peace River on the east side of
the Rocky Mountains, extends the greatest beaver
country in the world. It is known by Indian report
alone, as no white man ever penetrates far
into the wilderness of pine-forest and morass;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
many streams head away into the interior of this
unknown land, but the white man has only seen
their mouths, as he passes up or down the main
waterways of the North. It is true that the
Company's men have ascended Hay River, a large
stream falling into the Great Slave Lake, and by
making an overland portage, have dropped on the
Peace River at Fort Vermillion; but they have
always made hurried voyages and have had no
opportunity of exploring much new ground.</p>

<p>Scattered over this huge extent of country are
still a few bands of buffalo. Sometimes they are
heard of at Forts Smith and Vermillion, sometimes
at Fort St. John close up to the big mountains
on Peace River, and occasionally at Fort
Nelson on the south branch of the Liard. It is
impossible to say anything about their numbers,
as the country they inhabit is so large, and the Indians,
who are few in number, usually keep to
the same hunting-ground. These animals go by
the name of wood buffalo, and most people are
of opinion that they are a distinct race from the
old prairie buffalo so numerous in bygone days;
but I am inclined to think that the very slight
difference in appearance is easily accounted for
by climatic influences, variety of food, and the
better shelter of the woods. Here too the giant
moose and the woodland caribou have their home,
and even in the short journey that I made into
this district the tracks in the snow told a tale of
plenty. Many black bears' skins are brought out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
every year, and towards the mountains the formidable
grizzly is often encountered by the fearful
hunter. Nor are the small fur-bearing animals
wanting; foxes&mdash;red, cross, and a few silver&mdash;seek
their living on the prairie, while wolverines,
fisher, mink, marten, and lynx may be
trapped in the woods, and a few otters frequent
the streams and lakes. In the summer ducks,
geese, and many other water-birds have their
nests in the muskegs, and two or three varieties
of the tree grouse are always to be found. "The
hunter's Paradise!" says the sporting reader; "let
us go and have a hunt there." But now for the
other side of the picture. In the summer it is
practically impossible to travel, as it is a swampy
country not to be crossed with horses, and the
lakes are too far apart to be available as a canoe-route,
while the mosquitos are intolerable. Only
when the snow has fallen, and all water is held
fast in the grip of winter, has one a chance of
exploring this Land of Promise with dogs,
sleighs, and snow-shoes; but, by this time, the
summer life has all flown far away southward,
and, though I think one would be fairly safe in
pushing on, there is always a chance of coming
across a large tract of gameless country, and finding
a difficulty in obtaining provisions.</p>

<p>After three days' good travel we reached the
end of François' road, and long before daylight
on the following morning were away to try and
find the buffalo tracks. We had a long day's walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
over a perfect hunting-ground, crossing several
open ridges with sufficient elevation to give us a
view of the surrounding country. Prairie and
timber were about in equal proportion, and the
eye could follow the windings of a large stream
that falls into the Little Buffalo River close to
the Fort Smith portage; its water are strongly
impregnated with sulphur, and do not readily
freeze; in fact this stream, although it has little
current, remains open during a considerable part
of its course even in the coldest weather. About
noon we found the track that we had been looking
for, easily distinguishable from the many
tracks of moose and woodland caribou that we
had crossed; little François made a capital approach,
and after a couple of hours' walk we
sighted a band of eight buffalo feeding in a small
wood-surrounded swamp. There are few spots
on the American continent to-day where one can
see buffalo in their wild state, but the Indian gave
us no time to watch them, and completely spoilt
the chance of clean shooting by letting off his
gun too soon; we only wanted to kill one, as we
could not haul any more meat, and it is really a
pity to kill animals so nearly extinct as these.
As it turned out there were several snap-shots
fired as they ran into the woods, and two tracks
of blood in the snow showed that we had done
too much shooting, although it was not till late
in the second day that we secured a cow that had
travelled many miles before lying down.</p>

<p>By the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> it is as well when going for a
hunting expedition in the North to leave at home
all the old-fashioned notions of shooting-etiquette.
If you see a man in a good position for a shot,
run up, jostle his elbow, and let your gun off;
if an animal falls, swear you killed it, and claim
the back-fat and tongue no matter whether you
fired or not; never admit that you are not quite
sure which animal you shot at. It is only by
strict attention to these rules that a white man
can get a fair division of plunder when shooting
with half-breed Indians.</p>

<p>The other buffalo, on whose track there was
little blood, had not separated from the band, although
we followed it for a whole day, and, as
this was a sure sign of its having been only
slightly wounded, perhaps not much damage was
done; a badly struck animal will always leave its
companions and lie down.</p>

<p>There was much rejoicing when late on the
third night the result of our hunt was hauled into
our pleasant camp in a clump of thick pine-timber.
The little girl patted and played with the meat
as an English child would with a doll, and eventually
dropped off to sleep with the raw brisket
for a pillow; while Pierre, the boy, after a huge
feast was seized with such a violent fit that for a
long time I was afraid it would prove his last.
The others took no notice of him beyond putting
down a log to keep him from rolling in the fire,
and in the morning he seemed perfectly well and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
hungry as ever for buffalo-meat. With heavily-laden
sleighs we started back for the fort, but a
wind-storm had drifted up our track over the
prairie, and the dogs had hard work to drag their
loads. In one of our steel traps were the remains
of a cross fox that a wolverine had eaten, and
beyond a few more martens our fur-hunting was
unsuccessful. It took us four days to reach little
François' house at the mouth of the river, and
another half-day to get to the fort, where we
found everything quiet, as usual in the monotony
of the long winter. February was nearly over,
and the "moon of the big wind" was doing its
best to keep up its reputation. Day after day the
north wind howled over the lake, drifting the
snow into a vast ridge on the lee shore and making
it no easy matter to find the trout-lines, which
had now to be set four or five miles out at sea,
the fish moving into deep water as the cold gets
more intense and the ice thicker. The thermometer
hanging against the wall of the house ranged
between <i>minus</i> 30 and <i>minus</i> 45 degrees Fahrenheit,
and this state of affairs continued until I left
the fort for another hunt with little François.
We spent three weeks happily enough in the
woods, doing a little trapping, and getting enough
moose and caribou-meat to keep the dogs and
ourselves in good condition. Our course lay the
same way as on the last hunt, to take advantage
of the road and visit the line of traps; but we
pushed further on till we came across the tracks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of a party of Indians hunting from Fort Smith.
We saw no sign of buffalo, and as François' wife
damaged her leg rather badly we were obliged to
haul her back on the sleigh, and this accident put
an end to our trip. Away far in the forest beyond
the influence of the great frozen lake we
found the first indications of the coming spring.
By the end of the first week in April the snow
was falling under our snow-shoes in the middle
of the day, and the sun, which now had a long
course to run, shone with considerable power; the
pine-trees threw out the delicious scent so suggestive
of Nature's awakening after her long
snow-wrapped sleep, and a puff of warm south
wind, sighing through the poplars, whispered a
message of hope from a more favoured land. But
winter made a final struggle, and it was not till
the 25th of April that the collapse came. Then
the snow in the woods around the fort melted
away rapidly, and the bare ground showed in
patches. On May 1st water was standing in
pools over the ice in the bay, the snow had disappeared
except in the drifts, a light rain was
falling, and the first goose was killed from the
door of the master's house; small bands of wildfowl
were passing frequently, and cranes were
calling in the swamps to the southward; daylight
lingered in the sky all night, but there was always
a sharp frost while the sun was down.</p>

<p>It was time to shake off our luxurious habits
and push out again for the North to take full advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of the short summer of the Barren
Ground. The fort seemed to wake up with the
spring, and there was bustle and activity everywhere.
The furs had to be spread out to dry before
they could be baled up; fish had to be thrown
out of the provision-store as they thawed, and the
dogs were happy for once. There was talk of
ploughing and planting the potato-crop; Indians
kept dropping in with small bundles of fur, to
trade for ammunition for the goose-hunt, which
would soon be in full swing; canoes were patched
up and made tight in readiness for the first open
water. But there was a rumour that the expedition
to the Great Fish River would fall through,
as no crew could be found, and some discontented
spirits had been trying to persuade the Indians
against going with us; the half-breeds were all
full of excuses, and for a time it looked bad for
us. Mackinlay was of course keen enough for
the trip, and so was Murdo Mackay, the Scotch
engaged servant; and luckily David, an Esquimau
boy from Peel's River, who had been left
at Fort Resolution for the winter to learn English
from the Protestant missionary there, was
willing to come with us, and, although not a first-rate
traveller, might be very useful as interpreter
if we fell in with any of his countrymen. Moise
Mandeville was more obstinate and had the greatest
horror of the expedition, but he finally agreed
to come in the capacity of steersman and as
Montaignais' interpreter. We were still without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
a guide. Zinto, despite his promises, had not put
in an appearance, and there was as yet no news of
him. Meanwhile preparations went on; dogs
were got together, new snow-shoes provided for
each member of the party, and all available
pounded meat and grease converted into pemmican
as the most portable form of provisions; four
sacks of flour were forwarded to Fond du Lac
to await our arrival, and the women round the
fort were busy making moccasins for men and
dogs, as the latter have to be shod in spring-travelling,
to prevent their feet being cut to pieces
on the rough needle-ice that appears after the
snow has melted off the lakes. We also took a
light canvas lodge in place of the heavier deer-skins,
and found it a great saving in weight, especially
after rain; dressed deer-skins hold water
like a sponge, and where firewood is scarce are
extremely hard to dry.</p>

<p>On May 4th Mr. Clark arrived from Fort
Smith to take charge of Resolution during Mackinlay's
absence. The slushy state of the snow
made travelling hard, but the Fort Smith people
had managed to bring us a welcome supply of tea,
tobacco, ammunition, and a few matches; none of
these necessary articles were to be had at Resolution,
as the unusually heavy fur-trade had left
the store empty. We collected all the touch-wood
we could get hold of, and each took a flint and
steel, while Dr. Mackay sent us a burning-glass,
a compass, and a watch from Chipeweyan, besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
half a dozen pair of spectacles to keep off
snow-blindness, from which an unprotected eye
is sure to suffer. There was also a small stock
of axes, knives, and beads, presents for the Esquimaux
in case we fell in with them. Arrangements
were made for the fort boat to meet us at
the old site of Lockhart's house, at the north-east
end of the Great Slave Lake, on August 1st,
to bring us across the lake, as I wished to start
for the South in time to get back to civilization
before the rivers and lakes were set fast by the
coming winter.</p>

<p>The day after Mr. Clark's arrival a couple of
Indians came in from Fond du Lac. Zinto had
not yet arrived there, but was expected any day;
he had no meat for us, and caribou were reported
scarce on the road we proposed taking; most of
the Yellow Knives would be at Fond du Lac to
meet us if they found food enough for present
use. Pierre Lockhart, an Indian who had come to
the fort, immediately engaged with us as guide
to the Great Fish River, saying that whatever
the other men might do he would be faithful to
the end of the journey, even if we wanted him
to go to the sea-coast: needless to say he was
the very first to desert on the appearance of hard
times.</p>

<p>It was a goodly procession that left Fort Resolution
on the afternoon of May 7th, for every
sleigh was pressed into service to help us over
the bad ice that lay between the fort and the big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
river, and all the goose-hunters had been waiting
till we started to move their families to the favourite
feeding-grounds. Across the first bay
there was fully a foot of water, with a crust of
ice caused by the last night's frost; this top crust
had to be broken, and the dogs waded up to their
bellies, with the sleighs floating behind them: bitterly
cold for the feet and hard to avoid a fall,
which meant a thorough drenching in the icy
water. On reaching the delta and passing into
the narrow channels at the mouth of the big river
the ice was much better, as the water had run off
through the cracks; the crossing of the main
stream looked dangerous, but, by carefully picking
our way and sounding the ice with an axe, we
got across without accident and camped in a
bunch of willows on the far side. The fires were
kept up late that night and much talking was
done, as to-morrow we had to say good-bye to our
companions, and many instructions were given to
wives, mothers, and children with reference to
their good behaviour during our absence. The
red glow of sunset stayed in the sky till it mingled
with the brightness of the coming day; often a
whirr of wings told of a flock of wildfowl passing
overhead, and a few geese that had arrived from
the south kept up a continual <i>honking</i> as they
searched for a patch of open water to alight on.
But the frost was sharp in the night, and on breaking
camp at four o'clock we found the crust of
surface-ice in the next bay strong enough in most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
places to bear our sleighs, which were now reduced
to two in number and much more heavily
loaded than on the previous day. Sometimes a
man would break through, and, floundering on the
bottom ice, would bruise his shins and feet in a
desperate manner, and we were all badly knocked
about when we put ashore at Tête Noire's House,
five miles beyond the Ile de Pierre, ready to take
the big traverse on the following day. A couple
of hours out from the land brought us again to
dry snow, as the change of climate is very sudden
after leaving the south shore of the lake.
Crossing the big traverse was ordinary winter
travelling, although the snow was soft in the
strong sunshine; we made use of the frost at
night and generally rested during the heat of the
day. Between the islands snow-shoes were necessary,
and, although spectacles were constantly
worn, some of the men began to show signs of
snow-blindness; occasionally we found a bare
rock to camp on, but more generally made the old
winter form of encampment on the snow. It was
not till the sixth day after leaving the fort that
we pulled into Fond du Lac, and found nearly
the whole tribe of Yellow Knives awaiting us
with King Beaulieu and his family at their head;
there were five and twenty lodges, and in every
one we heard the old story of <i>Berula</i> (no meat);
they had tried fishing without success, and hoped
the white masters would give them a little flour
and pemmican. Why had they not pushed on to
some of the sure fisheries in the big lake when
they found the caribou fail? They wished to talk
with us, they said, and so had stayed and starved
at Fond du Lac till we came. What did they want
to speak to us about? Only this, that an Indian's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
life is hard, and he has at all times need of a little
tea and tobacco to give him courage; they had
heard we were taking much tea and tobacco, besides
other presents, to the Esquimaux. In vain
did we tell them that we had not enough for own
use; there was no peace till pipes were going in
every lodge.</p>

<p>Zinto had not put up any meat for us. At one
time he had killed a good many caribou, but he
had met with a band of Dog-Ribs from Fort Rae
and the two tribes had camped together; the chief
of the Yellow Knives was bound in honour to
give a feast to his guests, and after the meat that
was meant for us had been used for this purpose
they fell to gambling. The unfortunate Zinto
lost all his ammunition, so that he had no chance
to kill any more caribou, much as he would have
liked to help the white men in their undertaking.</p>

<p>The snow was lying deep in the woods and as
yet no breath of spring had visited Fond du Lac,
although at Fort Resolution, not more than one
hundred miles to the south, the buds were by this
time shooting on the birch and willow trees, and
the ground had been bare for two weeks; no
wildfowl had arrived, and the Indians were of
opinion that such a late spring had never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
known, advising us strongly not to attempt to
force our way into the Barren Ground till there
was some indication of better weather. It seemed
to us, though, that we should never be in a better
position to start than now, as any delay meant
waste of provisions, and we hoped to find
caribou before we began to starve. Several days
we spent in talking to the Indians before we
came to any satisfactory conclusion, and we
had the greatest trouble in persuading any of
them to come with us. Finally it was settled
that Capot Blanc, Saltatha, Syene, and Marlo,
with their wives and families, should start with
us, and on reaching the head of the Great Fish
River should wait there and hunt while we made
the descent of the stream. Capot Blanc behaved
very well at all the consultations, speaking
up for the white men whenever an opportunity
offered, but the interpretation was unsatisfactory;
Moise refused this duty in the presence
of the Beaulieus, and the latter, so far as
we could make out, used all their influence with
the Indians to damage our chances of making a
successful expedition. David, the Esquimau,
rather complicated matters by falling in love with
King's daughter, but he made no objection to
starting, and soon forgot all about her in the excitement
of the journey. On the last evening that
we spent at Fond du Lac a Dog-Rib arrived with
his family from the Barren Ground in a wretched
state of starvation. He had come in by the route<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
that we proposed to take, and gave a very unsatisfactory
report of the country: the cold was
still severe, and he had met with no game since
leaving the musk-ox a couple of weeks before;
one of his children had died of starvation and he
was forced to bury her under the snow at the Lac
de Mort; the rest had barely escaped with life.
Of course we gave them enough flour and pemmican
to take them to a well-known fishery twenty
miles on, but our provisions were going very
fast. Most of the Yellow Knives had already
moved away to the fishery, and the encampment
was entirely deserted when we pulled down our
lodges on the morning of May 21st. Paul Beaulieu
was to have caught us up to show us some
meat-<i>caches</i> that he had made in the winter, and
we had engaged an Indian, Carquoss, to fish for
his wife while he was away; but we saw neither
Paul nor his <i>caches</i>. Carquoss, however, joined
us later on, and explained that he had given up
fishing because we had not left him any tea and
the other Indians had laughed at him.</p>

<p>A miserable-looking outfit we were as we
plodded for two days along the north shore of the
lake, against a strong head-wind and driving
snowstorms. Seven trains of starving dogs
hauled their loads in a melancholy procession,
and over twenty people walked in the narrow road
made by the passage of the sleighs; by far too
large a party for any rapid travelling, and badly
handicapped by women and children. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
third day we turned up the mountain, and followed
the course of a stream coming in on the
north shore; we mounted by a series of frozen
cascades, many of them so steep that we were
obliged to use ropes to help the dogs, and towards
evening camped at the far end of the first lake on
the plateau. This day's work was not got through
without a good deal of growling, as everybody
was kept on short rations to make the most of
our provisions; three days' full allowance for
human beings alone, to say nothing of the thirty
dogs, would have put an end to our supplies.</p>

<p>From this lake the country was level, and the
women were quite able to manage the dog-sleighs,
while the men scoured the country on either side
of the track in search of caribou or ptarmigan.
The birds were fairly plentiful, but of course at
this season were all paired, and there was no
chance of making a slaughter at a single shot, as
one can do in the fall of the year when the birds
are in big packs; this shooting at separate birds
was a serious strain on our ammunition, but the
ptarmigan helped us out till we fell in with the
caribou. It was almost a certainty to find these
birds in every bunch of pines, and they kept up
such a constant crowing round the camp at night
that they had a poor chance of escaping the hungry
man's gun. After the snow has melted the
male bird gets pugnacious and runs up to meet
the hunter, with his feathers puffed out, offering
a fair mark for a stone; but before this happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
we disdained ptarmigan, and would only kill
the fattest-looking caribou. We eked out a precarious
existence in this manner for a week, making
short days' journeys, as the dogs could not
travel fast or far. Pierre Lockhart deserted one
morning when breakfast was particularly scanty,
and taking his gun and blanket started back for
Fond du Lac; we were depending on him for
guide, but it was rather a relief when he went, as
he was inclined to steal food, and had several
disgusting habits that made his absence from the
lodge rather acceptable than otherwise. Marlo's
brother-in-law disappeared about the same time,
but we thought they had gone off together and did
not trouble ourselves further about them.</p>

<p>On the last day of May, acting on Capot
Blanc's advice, we forked from our canoe-route,
and took a more easterly course, to fall on the
chain of lakes by which Anderson and Stewart
had reached the Great Fish River. We hoped to
find caribou in this direction, and on the same
day that we made this change in our course the
indefatigable Saltatha, having made a much
longer round than the rest of us, came into camp
late at night with a load of caribou-meat on his
back; he had seen snow-shoe tracks to the east,
but falling in with the caribou had turned back
to the camp without following the tracks.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 1st, brought a distinct change in
the weather; a mild south-west wind was melting
the snow rapidly, and several flocks of geese and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
ducks passed to the north. A few geese were
called up to the camp and killed from the doors
of the lodges; the Indians imitate to perfection
the cry of any bird, and at this time of year the
geese are easy to call, as they are always in search
of open water, and seem not a bit surprised to
hear their friends calling to them from a group
of deer-skin lodges. In the morning we sent two
men to bring in the rest of Saltatha's meat, with
orders to investigate the tracks, and see if there
was another encampment of Indians to the east,
as none of the caribou hunters had intended to
leave the Great Slave Lake till the thaw came.
Our peaceful Sunday was greatly disturbed by a
royal row in one of the lodges, and we sent for
Capot Blanc to ask him what the trouble was.
The old fellow was glad enough to get into our
lodge away from the clamour, and explained the
cause of the disturbance in his even low-pitched
voice, so pleasantly contrasted with the Yellow
Knife Billingsgate that was being freely used
outside. "It is the women," he said; "the wife of
Syene has called the wife of Saltatha by a bad
name, because she would not give her some meat;
the wife of Saltatha has taken the wife of Syene
by the hair and beaten her in the face with a
snow-shoe till her nose bleeds very much; the
men have tried to separate them, but that only
makes things worse. It is always like this in our
camps when we starve. If the men are alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
they are quiet; but when there are women there
is no peace. Is it so also in your country?"</p>

<p>Late in the night the men who had gone to
fetch the meat came back, hauling on the sleigh
Marlo's brother-in-law José, whom they had
found lying in the snow, without fire, in a bunch
of dwarf pines; the snow-shoe tracks were his,
and but for the lucky chance of Saltatha's killing
the caribou in that direction he must have perished
in a day or two, as he was too weak to
travel. He had left us to hunt ptarmigan, and
lost himself eight days ago, and, as we supposed
he had deserted with Pierre, we had taken no
trouble to look for him. He was one of the unlucky
ones, believed to have seen "the Enemy" in
his youth, and it certainly says little for his wits
that he was unable to follow the tracks of such a
large party. José had used up what little ammunition
he started with on the first day, and
since then had eaten nothing; he was without
matches or touchwood to make fire, and as the
weather had been cold he must have suffered
greatly. We fed him up to the best of our ability,
and he recovered rapidly when meat was
abundant in the camp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p>On the following day we made an easy day's
travel to the east, and most of us succeeded in
killing caribou while the women drove the dogs.
From this time, all through the summer till we
again reached the Great Slave Lake late in August,
we had no difficulty about provisions; although
there was many a time when we could not
say where we might find our next meal, something
always turned up, and we were never a single
day without eating during the whole journey.
I really believe it is a mistake to try to carry
enough food for a summer's work in the Barren
Ground, as the difficulty of transport is so great,
and after the caribou are once found there is no
danger of starvation.</p>

<p>We were now travelling with the bull caribou,
which had just left the thick woods, and made
easy marches from lake to lake in an north-east
direction; the weather became cold again for the
last time, and June 7th was like a bad winter's
day with a strong north wind and snowstorms.
Then the summer came suddenly, and on the 11th
we were obliged to camp on a high gravel ridge
to await <i>le grand dégel</i>, which rendered travelling
impossible, till the deep water had run off the ice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Although we had been so far taking it very easily,
a rest was of great service, as many of the party
were suffering from acute snow-blindness caused
by the everlasting glare of the sun on the treeless
waste; there was no dark object to rest the
eyes upon for a moment, and besides the actual
pain the constant inflammation injured the sight
and made rifle-shooting very uncertain. The Indians
smeared their faces with blood and wood-ashes,
and the white men were further protected
with spectacles; but these efforts were only partially
successful in keeping off the glare. I was
lucky in getting off quite free myself, but should
imagine that it must be a most painful affliction.</p>

<p>Along the foot of the sandy ridge, which closely
resembled the one I had seen the autumn before
at Lac de Gras, were many small lakes partially
thawed, and here the snow geese, or white
"wavies," were resting in thousands, waiting till
the warm weather should have melted the snow
from their feeding-ground along the sea-coast.
We could have made enormous bags of them, as
they were tame and disinclined to leave the open
water; but we were sparing with our ammunition,
as we might want it badly later on. Great
numbers were killed, however, and their prime
condition told of the good feeding-ground they
had left far southward. There were also plenty
of large Canada geese, but the grey wavy, or
laughing goose, the best of all for eating, is much
scarcer. Of the more edible ducks the pintail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
seems to be the only one that comes so far beyond
the Great Slave Lake, but long-tailed ducks
and golden eyes were in great numbers along this
sandy ridge. Of the loons, the red-throated variety
was by far the most numerous, and the Pacific
or Adam's diver was fairly common, but the
great northern diver, although plentiful on the
Great Slave Lake, does not appear to visit the
Barren Ground.</p>

<p>While we were waiting here, another band of
Indians from Fond du Lac caught us up, and
our camp assumed still larger proportions; but
as we were fairly among the game it did not much
matter. With the new arrivals were two blind
men, Pierre and Antoine Fat, who preferred
a wandering life to the support they would doubtless
have been given at the fort. Both were
good fishermen, and would spend hours sitting
on the ice at the edge of an open hole with the
greatest patience, and later on made heavy catches
of trout. Pierre would often walk with the hunters
to get his share of the meat; Capot Blanc was
usually his guide, but seldom did more than trail
a stick after him and the blind man followed the
sound; when a caribou was killed, Pierre was led
up to it, and in spite of his blindness would do
the butcher's work cleanly and well.</p>

<p>The snow melted away rapidly; the hillsides
were running with small streams, the ground
showed up in ever increasing patches, and a thick
mist, which the Indians say always appears at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
time of the big thaw, hung over everything. On
June 16th we found that most of the water had
run off through the cracks in the ice, and resumed
our journey, after solemnly burning some thirty
pairs of used-up snow-shoes. At first walking
without them seemed hard to me, as I had used
them continually since the previous October, and
we all found that our feet were made sore by
walking on the rough ice; unfortunately the skins
of the caribou that we killed were so riddled by
grubs that they were unfit to dress for leather,
and we were always short of moccasins. We still
travelled along easily, as the river would not break
up for a fortnight at the earliest, and our best
plan was to move with the caribou, which seemed
to be keeping up with the edge of the snow much
in the same manner as ourselves. The portages
between the lakes were often three or four miles
in length, and, as the snow had gone, we were
obliged to carry the heavy loads on our backs;
firewood was getting scarce, and I came to the
conclusion that our old canoe-route was by far
the best way to reach the Barren Ground in summer
or in winter. A few warm days made a
great difference in the appearance of the country.
Leaves began to sprout on the little willows, and
the grass showed green on the hillsides; sober-hued
flowers, growing close to the ground, came
out in bloom, and a few butterflies flapped in the
hot sunshine, while we were still walking on eight
feet of solid ice. Mosquitos appeared in myriads:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
in the daytime there was usually a breeze to blow
them away, and the nights were too cold for
them; but in the calm mornings and evenings
they made the most of their chance to annoy us.</p>

<p>On June 25th we planted our lodges on a high
ridge overlooking Lake Mackay. It has always
been the fashion of the Yellow Knives to camp
in an elevated position, in order to have command
of the surrounding country in looking out for the
caribou, or, in the olden times, for a band of hostile
Indians. Right across the lake we could see
the bay in which we had left our big canoe during
our first attempt to find the musk-ox, and the
hills forming the height of land between the Great
Slave Lake and the Arctic Sea; on our right lay
Lockhart's River and the huge Aylmer Lake,
which we were about to cross. Blind Pierre knew
the whole picture as well as any of us; on my
way back to camp at sundown I found him sitting
on a boulder smoking, for we always rather
favoured him in the matter of tobacco; his face
was turned to the north-east, and he was evidently
taking in all the details of the landscape,
without the sense of sight. "<i>Tetchenula</i>, <i>Tetchen
Yarsula</i>, <i>Tetchen Taote</i> (no wood, not a little
wood, no wood at all)," he said, as he waved his
hands towards Aylmer Lake; then, with a sweep
of his arm, he traced correctly the course of
Lockhart's River, with a rapid downward motion,
to denote its abrupt termination in a series of
rapids and waterfalls as it joins the Great Slave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Lake. Poor old fellow, it must be hard for him
not to see the country he loves so well; but he is
happy, after his fashion, in the summer-time
when the caribou are thick.</p>

<p>From this point we sent Moise with three Indians
and our own dogs to bring up the big canoe
from the south shore of Lake Mackay, where I
had left her in the beginning of last October.
Many little hunting-canoes had been picked up
along the track from Fond du Lac, and now every
sleigh carried a canoe athwartships; these proved
useful enough in crossing the small lake in the
course of Lockhart's River, as on arriving at the
far side we found open water between us and the
land, and had to use the canoes to ferry our
cargo to the shore, the dogs swimming with the
empty sleighs in tow, while some enterprising
spirits, who conceived the idea of floating ashore
on blocks of ice, came in for a ducking. The ice
on Aylmer Lake was still solid, but extremely
rough, causing great damage to our moccasins.
We kept near the north shore, with sometimes a
long traverse across a deep bay; at the head of
every bay a stream ran into the lake, and the
open water at its mouth was always a sure find
for trout; forty or fifty large fish were often
caught in a day with hook and line at these places,
and, as we could always kill caribou, even the
dogs were getting fat in this land of plenty. Soon
we began to see scraps of musk-ox hair on the
large boulders where these animals had been rubbing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and on the second day's travel along Aylmer
Lake David had an adventure with an old bull.
David was by far the keenest hunter in the outfit,
but up till now had not succeeded in killing anything
bigger than a goose, and it was an exciting
moment for him when he got within range of a
musk-ox. He had heard strange stories about
these animals when a small boy among his own
countrymen at the mouth of the Mackenzie River,
and it was not without a little trembling that he
fired one of his scanty stock of bullets. The beast
was wounded but would not die, and David,
standing off at a safe distance, soon exhausted
all his bullets; he then proceeded to load his gun
with round stones, and finally with handfuls of
gravel; his last charge of powder was used to
fire the ramrod, but another half hour elapsed
before the musk-ox expired. As this was the first
one that had been killed on this trip, the proud
hunter was made a good deal of when he came
into camp with the best of the highly-flavoured
meat.</p>

<p>On the evening of July 1st we made the encampment
at the head of the most northerly bay
of Aylmer Lake, named Sandy Bay by Back,
from the conspicuous sand-ridges that here form
the divide between the lake and the Great Fish
River, a distance of three quarters of a mile. The
ice was still firm in Aylmer Lake, but there was
a little difficulty in getting ashore through a narrow
belt of open water, and the head-reaches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the river were clear. We were inspecting the
stream, to see what chance there was of being
able to run the canoe through the numerous
rapids, when Noel, one of the Indians who had
been with me on the winter hunt, came up with
the news that he had spied a large band of musk-ox
feeding a couple of miles down the river. The
women were badly in need of their hides for making
moccasins, as the caribou-skins were still in
poor condition, so a hunt was arranged in a fashion
that I had not seen before. Most of the guns
crossed the river, and a spot was selected for the
slaughter just where the stream broadened out
into a small lake; at right angles to the river
mounds of stone and moss were put up at a few
yards' distance from each other, ornamented with
coats, belts, and gun-covers, and behind the outside
mound Capot Blanc took up his position. A
steep hill ran parallel with the stream about two
hundred yards away, and along this guns were
posted at intervals, with the intention of heading
the musk-ox towards the water. Noel and Marlo,
supposed to be the two best runners, were to
make a long round and start the band in our
direction; I was stationed with three other guns
among some broken rocks on the south side of
the river, just opposite the barrier; and orders
were given that no shot should be fired till the
musk-ox took to the water.</p>

<p>It was a most interesting scene, and I would
not willingly have changed places with any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the loyal Canadians who were at this time celebrating
the anniversary of Dominion Day, with
much rye whisky, a thousand miles to the southward.
I had plenty of time to admire the surrounding
landscape, and the sunset that lit up the
snow-drifts on each side of the river; when suddenly
over the opposite ridge appeared the horns
of a band of caribou, and for a moment the leader
was outlined against the sky as he paused to look
at the strange preparations going on in the valley
below. Behind me a ptarmigan, perched on a
rock, crowed defiance; but there was no other
sound, except the rush of water and the occasional
grinding of an ice-pan dislodged from some
small lake in the course of the stream. Fully an
hour we sat among the rocks, and were beginning
to think that the hunt had miscarried, when
we heard a distant shouting far down the valley,
and the next moment caught sight of a scurrying
black mass crossing a spur of the hill close to the
river's bank. The men posted along the ridge
took up the cry as the musk-ox passed them, and
joined in the chase; soon the animals came to the
barrier, and pulled up short at the apparition,
while, to increase their alarm, the hoary head of
Capot Blanc arose from behind a mound of rocks
right in front of them. This was the critical
moment, and they would certainly have taken to
the water and been at the mercy of their pursuers
but for an untimely shot that caused them to
break, and I was not sorry to see that several of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the band escaped. I had had a splendid view till
now, as the musk-ox halted within twenty yards
of me, but we were forced to lie low when the
shooting began, as bullets were rattling freely
among the rocks in which we were hiding. We
did no shooting on our side of the river, except
to finish off a couple that took to the water; seven
were killed in all, six cows, and a calf about a
month old; there were no bulls in the band, and
from what I afterwards saw they seemed to keep
separate from the cows during the summer. A
solitary old bull is often met with at this time of
year.</p>

<p>When the hunt was over, I inquired the meaning
of the shouting that had been kept up so continually
throughout the drive, and was informed
that this was necessary to let the musk-ox know
which way to run. At starting they had shouted,
"Oh, musk-ox, there is a barrier planted for you
down there, where the river joins the little lake;
when you reach it take to the water, there are
men with guns on both sides, and so we shall
kill you all"; when the men are out of breath,
they shout to the musk-ox to stop, and, after
they have rested, to go on again. These animals
are said to understand every word of the
Yellow Knife language, though it seems strange
that they do not make use of the information they
receive to avoid danger instead of obeying orders.
The partial failure of the hunt was attributed to
the fact that Moise had called across the river to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
me in French, and the musk-ox had not been able
to understand this strange language.</p>

<p>The sun had risen again when we got back to
camp, and there we found the big canoe, not a bit
damaged by her long rest under the snow or her
adventurous journey on the dog-sleigh. The day
was spent in getting in the meat and skins, and
early the next morning we carried the canoe
across the portage and launched her on the waters
of the Great Fish River. The cargo was all sent
overland to a lake some six miles down the
stream; sleighs were abandoned, as there was now
no snow to haul on, but the dogs' work was by
no means over, the only difference being that they
had to carry loads on their backs instead of dragging
a sleigh; rough deer-skin pack-harness was
made, and the loads secured in a manner worthy
of a Mexican mule-packer. We came to grief with
the canoe at the third rapid, and should have done
much better to have made the portage to the lake,
instead of trying to navigate the difficult stream.
A long delay was necessary to effect repairs, and
there were so many portages over ice-blocks along
the edge of the lake, when we reached it, that the
sun was high on the following morning before
we camped. The same work continued for several
days, the Indians toiling overland heavily
loaded, and our own party struggling with the
ice in a chain of lakes through which the river
runs. On the edge of one of these lakes we
stopped for dinner on the spot where Stewart and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Anderson separated from their Indian guides before
descending the river in 1856. The rough
stone fireplaces, by which they had economised
fuel, were still standing, and Capot Blanc, seated
on one of them, gave us a long lecture on the
events that had taken place during their expedition,
as he had heard the story from his father.
More than thirty years had elapsed since the last
party of Whites camped by the side of the Great
Fish River, and thirty years again before them
Back the discoverer had pushed out into the unknown
land. Why has all exploration in the Barren
Ground ceased? No more is known of the
country than was discovered by Franklin and
Back sixty years ago in their short summer journeys,
and the expeditions sent out in search of the
former in the 'Fifties. There are many thousands
of square miles on which the foot of white man
has never stepped. The Canadian Government
has an efficient body of surveyors and geologists
at its command, and it is curious that no attention
is paid to one of the most interesting fields
for exploration.</p>

<p>On July 6th, after slow and tiresome travelling,
we reached the north end of a large sheet of
water named by Back Musk-ox Lake, and finding
enough willow-scrub for firewood, determined
here to await the breaking up of the ice in the
lake. Judging by the Indian's account the season
was fully three weeks later than usual, and, as I
wished to be back at Fort Resolution in time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
save the open water up Peace River before winter
set in, there was a poor chance of our being
able to penetrate far into the country of the Esquimaux.
Musk-ox Lake runs pretty nearly due
north and south, and is fifteen miles in length,
averaging about two miles in width. Our camp
was just at the point where the river runs out,
and a short distance above is the best swimming-place
for the caribou known to the Indians. In
some years immense slaughters are made here,
but on the present occasion the caribou did not
cross in their usual numbers, so that our companions
had no chance to put up the dried meat that
we expected to get for our cruise down stream,
and we could only kill enough for the present
support of such a large encampment. Across the
lake is a hill of insignificant height, known as
the Musk-ox Mountain, a good landmark, and a
favourite haunt for the animals from which it
takes its name.</p>

<p>This is the northerly limit of the Yellow
Knives' hunting-ground. Northwards is the land
of the dreaded Esquimaux, and many rumours
were brought into the camp of a strange track
seen on soft ground, of men standing far off on
the sky-line, and a blue cloud of smoke arising
far down the valley of the river. The Indians
were convinced that their old enemies were continually
close to them, despite the fact that it
would be an impossibility for canoes to have yet
ascended the stream on account of the ice. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
afterwards discovered that there was a debatable
ground, fully sixty miles in width, between
Musk-ox Lake and the highest point that the Esquimaux
reach.</p>

<p>There is here a very striking change in the appearance
of the country. The old red granite
formation gives way almost entirely to ironstone,
split up into slabs and piled into such peculiar
shapes that one might imagine giants had been
building castles over the rolling hills. Some of
the slabs were turned on edge and formed perfect
turrets towering many feet into the air, and
in many places were heaps of shiny black sand,
resembling coal-dust, piled up into conical mounds
almost too steep to climb. Wherever vegetation
had a chance to grow it was much more luxuriant
than one could suppose possible in such a climate.
The stunted willows, not two feet in height, were
thickly clothed with bright green leaves; there was
abundance of grass, and in many spots the pretty
little Arctic flowers formed a bright carpet along
the foot of a slowly melting snowdrift.</p>

<p>Capot Blanc and myself made an expedition
into the roughest part of this country, to the
north-east of Musk-ox Lake, but we found travelling
very hard, as we had to climb continually
over broken masses of ironstone. This is another
well-known haunt of "the Enemy," and
Capot Blanc attributed to his malign influence the
disaster that prevented our further exploration
in this direction. We reached a stream of no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
great size, one of the tributaries of the Great Fish
River, and attempted to wade across to the opposite
bank, selecting the head of a small rapid
for the purpose, as the water appeared to be shallower
there. On reaching the centre of the current
our legs were swept from under us, and
we were immediately running the rapid at the
imminent risk of breaking our heads against a
rock. We both reached the still water at the
foot of the rapid with nothing worse than a few
bruises, and moreover held on to our guns, but of
course our ammunition was spoilt, and we were
obliged to make the best of our way back to
camp. Capot Blanc afterwards told me that he
thought the Enemy had made the water strong,
to keep us from coming into his country, and it
would be flying in the face of Providence to
make another attempt. It would be interesting to
know how far this ironstone formation extends;
and, as the journey to Musk-ox Lake and back to
the fort might easily be made by canoe during
the summer, the trip would amply repay the geologist
and botanist for their trouble.</p>

<p>Many other little expeditions we made in
various directions, sometimes watching the birds,
and sometimes in pursuit of caribou or musk-ox.
One hunt in particular I remember, which took
place appropriately enough on the top of Musk-ox
Mountain. We had made out the moving black
spots through the glasses from the lodge, and, as
there was still a demand for hides from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
women and meat was being used in great quantities,
we paddled across the lake through a narrow
channel in the ice. The sun went down while
we were climbing the ascent, and a long wait
was necessary, as the animals were feeding towards
us on the flat top of the mountain and there
was no cover to enable us to make a nearer approach.
The mosquitos buzzed merrily round us
while we lay behind the rock and watched the
grotesque motions of the calves as they played
with each other, little suspecting that danger was
so close. Presently the band moved within easy
range and we opened fire with four guns. Seven
were killed, and Mackinlay caught a calf that
stayed by the body of its dead mother, a fluffy,
long-haired little beast; I was sorry that we could
not keep it alive, but it would have been impossible
to carry it in a birch-bark canoe. Cruel
work, this shooting in the summer-time, but it
was necessary to keep the camp in meat even
though mother and young had to be sacrificed.
I had a long run after a cripple, and eventually
killed it on the shore of a large lake in a valley
eastward of the mountain. The sun was high
when I found the rest of the hunters eating marrow-bones
in front of a big fire, in a clump of
well-grown willows close to the canoe, and we
took a load of wood back to the camp, sending
over the women for the meat and skins later in
the day.</p>

<p>The weather during this time was variable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the extreme; two or three hot days would be followed
by a snowstorm, and once we were visited
by a hurricane that did much damage to lodge-poles,
and caused us to shift camp hurriedly to the
lee-side of a steep cliff hanging over the river.
July 10th was exceptionally hot in the morning,
with the mosquitos at their worst; in the middle
of the day there was a thunderstorm, and at five
o'clock the ground was covered with snow. The
ice now began to show signs of rotting, and the
channel of open water round the weather edge
of the lake grew rapidly broader.</p>

<p>We had many talks with the Indians about the
chances of our being able to get together a crew;
but they had no enthusiasm about the voyage, and
wanted nothing better than to keep us hanging
about the head of the river, providing them with
ammunition. Saltatha was the only one of the
band who volunteered to go, and he insisted on
having another Indian with him, as he was not
used to the ways of white men, and would feel
safer if he had one of his own tribe with him in
case of accidents; but he hoped we should not go
farther than the big lake (Beechey Lake) which
he had heard us talking about, for it was getting
late in the year, and when the ice is long in melting
winter comes again soon. At last it was arranged
that Saltatha and Noel were to come in
our canoe, while Marlo and Carquoss accompanied
us with a small hunting-canoe, to carry a
little ammunition in case we lost our cargo by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
capsizing in a rapid; we should then have a chance
of making a living, and be able to cross the tributary
stream if we had to return on foot. On
our part we agreed to turn back from Beechey
Lake, reserving the privilege of taking the little
canoe overland from there to Bathurst Inlet. As
caribou were scarce, the rest of the Indians were
to work their way back towards the Great Slave
Lake, except Capot Blanc, who was to stay on
the divide at Aylmer Lake, if he could kill enough
meat to keep his family, and there await our return.</p>

<p>The evening before we started, Syene, who was
a Medicine Man, sent a message to our lodge that
he was going to foretell the result of our expedition
down the river, so we went over to hear what
was in store for us. His lodge was full of Indians,
but they made room for us, and we sat
down on a blanket on the side of the fire farthest
from the door. Syene held a drum made of
tightly-stretched deer-skin parchment, which he
punched continually with a caribou's thigh-bone,
keeping up a melancholy chant, and singing a sentence
or two every few minutes. "It is not that I
can see anything myself," he said, "but it is an
unborn child that is speaking to me." Mrs. Syene,
who was sitting close to the Medicine Man,
clasped her hands and groaned, as if in great
pain, by way of giving assent to this statement.
"The child sees the canoe of the big masters running
down the strong water of a rapid; below the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
rapid is a long point, and seven lodges of the
Esquimaux are planted on the point. There is
blood on the snow-drift; it is the blood of a white
man. One man is walking on the bank of a river;
he walks like a starving man, and the child knows
not if he is white or Indian. Now all is dark,
and the child has ceased speaking."</p>

<p>Not a very cheerful prophecy, and it was hard
to make out how far the Indians believed in the
Medicine Man; but our crew were rather downhearted
about it, although, as is usual all the
world over, the people who were not going the
journey themselves took a philosophical view of
the whole affair.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p>On Thursday, July 17th, at two o'clock in the
afternoon, we struck camp and started on a four-mile
portage to the next lake down stream, as
the river-bed was too full of large boulders to
navigate the strong current with safety. It was
hard work carrying the cargo and canoe through
the mosquito-stricken ironstone country, and we
did not camp till midnight. Here another bad
omen was observed. Mackinlay and I had gone
ahead, after carrying over a load, to try and kill
something for supper; we found a musk-ox, but
made rather a clumsy mess of killing it, and the
animal was badly heated before we finished it off.
The meat was consequently discoloured, and Saltatha
declared this to be an unfailing sign of
some great misfortune at hand. The women had
made us a few pair of moccasins each, but not
nearly enough for the tracking-work that we
should have to do when we turned up stream;
and our stock of provisions, instead of the bales
of dried meat that we had expected to enable us
to travel without waste of time in hunting, consisted
of ten dried deers'-ribs, so full of maggots,
from having been imperfectly cured, that we
threw them away on the second day out. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
flour and pemmican had of course been finished
long ago, and we drank the last kettleful of tea
before leaving Musk-ox Lake, but as the Labrador
tea grows all over this country in profusion,
this did not much matter; tobacco too was nearly
at an end.</p>

<p>The lake was still full of floating ice, but we
had no trouble in passing the canoe into the river
at the north end, and found the stream considerably
increased in volume by a couple of large
tributaries that come in from the opposite sides
of the lake. After dropping down two or three
miles with a sluggish current, we heard the roar
of a rapid, and put ashore on an island in mid-stream
as soon as we sighted broken water. It
was lucky we did so, as there was a heavy overfall
impossible to run, and we were obliged to
portage the whole length of the island and then
shoot the tail of the rapid. Here we put ashore
to patch the canoe, which was leaking badly, and
pulled out big trout as quickly as we could throw
in the spoon-bait; we found this could be done at
the foot of all the rapids, so one need not take
much thought about provisions in this part of the
stream. After another small rapid, which was
run with a full load, the river, heading straight
to the north, passes through a small lake and
emerges as a broad canal-like waterway with very
slight current, flowing through the roughest part
of the ironstone country that we had yet seen;
the banks were steep too, and we could put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
canoe alongside a natural wharf in any spot for
a distance of five or six miles. In passing down
these reaches we saw and killed musk-ox, but
the caribou seemed to shirk the labour of crossing
the confused masses of rocks, and none of
these animals were seen till we reached a less
rugged district. Again the channel widened out
into a lake, two miles in length, with an ugly
rapid at the north end; this we negotiated with
the precaution of leaving guns and ammunition
ashore, and directly afterwards Saltatha caused
some excitement by saying he had caught a
glimpse of a man walking on a neighbouring
ridge; we put ashore, but could find no tracks,
and came to the conclusion that it was Saltatha's
imagination. A long day's travel was made successfully,
and by ten o'clock we were clear of the
ironstone and slipping quietly along through a
pleasant sandy country. We camped at the foot
of a high sand-butte covered with flowers and
moss, and found a bunch of willows on the bank
of the river. There were indications that some
one had camped on the same spot many years
ago; small sticks had been chopped with an axe,
and bones of caribou were lying in heaps on the
ground. The Yellow Knives at once said it was
an old Esquimaux camp, and it was evident that
they had little inclination to go any farther down
stream; more probably the chopping was done by
a band of Dog-Ribs, whose hunting-grounds lie
to the west, or possibly by the members of Stewart's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and Anderson's expeditions. On mounting
the butte we saw that the country northward presented
a much more fertile appearance than anything
we had seen on the south side of the watershed.
There was a luxurious growth of grass
over the sandy ridges, and during the two months
of summer one could imagine oneself back on the
prairies of Alberta; the willows here too grew to
a better size, and, as far as we descended the
river, we had little trouble about fuel; in the winter,
of course, the willows would be all drifted
over with snow, and it would then be no easy
matter to make a fire. This stream heads in the
woodless country; consequently there is no drift-timber,
and not a single pine-tree is to be seen
along its course.</p>

<p>We had a pleasant camp enough that night, but
rebellion was rife and burst into flame on the
following morning when we ordered the men
to take their places in the canoes. This is the
hopeless part of having to rely on natives for
travelling in the Barren Ground; they have no
courage outside their own country. If we had
had a good crew of half-breeds from Red River
or the upper country of British Columbia we
might even now, notwithstanding the lateness of
the season, have pushed far out towards the
northern sea-coast, and possibly have made the acquaintance
of some of the scattered bands of Esquimaux
who live there in happy ignorance of
any more comfortable form of life. But we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
practically in the hands of the Yellow Knives,
for although I would myself have taken the risk
of steering, none of the men who were willing
to go knew how to stitch up a broken canoe, and
it would have been madness to push on without
this knowledge. Moise, our half-breed interpreter
and steersman, who was an engaged servant
of the Hudson's Bay Company and bound by his
contract to obey Mackinlay's orders in everything,
showed the Indian side of his nature by joining
the mutineers and refusing to take his position in
the stern of the canoe. For two hours we argued
the matter on the bank of the river, and at one
time I thought we should certainly have come to
blows. Marlo and Carquoss were the ringleaders,
but Saltatha was inclined to stand by us,
although afraid of giving offence to the other Indians.
The result of the dispute was that the
worst two deserted, taking with them the little
canoe, while Noel and Saltatha, tempted by many
promises of great reward when we reached the
fort, agreed to come with us, and Moise sulkily
went back to his duty. After we had thus got
rid of the element of discord things went on better;
but the loss of the little canoe, besides doing
away with our chance of crossing overland to
Bathurst Inlet, increased the risk of losing all
our possessions by one disaster. A pretty poetical
thing is a birch-bark canoe, as it leaps down a
sparkling river among its native birch woods, but
too frail a craft for a long journey in the rockbound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
country beyond the line where timber
grows. No chance here to strip the bark from
a birch-tree and put a new side in a canoe that
has struck a rock in the foaming rapid, or if
needs be to build a new canoe altogether; three
square feet of birch-bark, a little gum, and a
bundle of fibre were our only resources for effecting
repairs.</p>

<p>The day's journey began with a rapid, below
which was a reach of quiet water gradually broadening
out into a lake some eight miles in length;
its surface was covered with ice at the north end,
but we found an open channel close ashore on the
west side and effected a passage through by skirting
the bays. Several bands of musk-ox were
seen, and there was always too much anxiety
among the men to put ashore and shoot, or to do
anything except push steadily on; just as we were
leaving the lake a magnificent bull appeared on
the top of a high ridge, and, standing on a flat
rock within one hundred yards of us, leisurely
surveyed the first human beings who had encroached
upon his sanctuary for so many years.</p>

<p>Below the lake the river makes a sharp bend
eastward, and for three miles is nothing but a
succession of rapids. Moise when once at work
was a splendid steersman, and he certainly
handled the canoe with great skill through this
difficult piece of navigation; we passed the mouths
of two big streams coming in from the west, and
at camping-time shot into a quiet sandy lake and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
put ashore for the night. A musk-ox that I killed
from the door of the lodge, and the unlimited
number of trout that we could catch in the river,
enabled us to spend a peaceful Sunday without
hunting. We explored towards the east, and came
once more upon the iron country, which seems to
run with a sharply defined edge in a north-easterly
direction. There were few lakes out of the course
of the river, but long stretches of flat grassy
muskegs extended as far as the eye could see to
the west. Four-footed game was plentiful, especially
musk-ox; the caribou that we saw were
generally solitary bucks, but it was now nearly
time for the does to be coming back from the sea-coast;
of the smaller animals we often came
across a skulking wolf, a wolverine, an Arctic
fox, or a hare, while the holes in the sand-hills
were the abode of numerous <i>siffleurs</i> and ermines.
A ferocious little mouse, brown in summer, but
turning white as the winter comes on, is very
common all over the Barren Ground; if disturbed
from a tuft of grass it will turn on a man and
dance with impotent rage at his feet; these mice
naturally fall an easy prey to the hawks and owls,
which make a good living here during the summer
months. Beyond these predatory birds little
feathered life was visible in this part of the country;
a few gulls, terns, and skuas flitted along the
reaches of the river, and occasionally a loon or
a long-tailed duck could be seen in the lakes. The
Canada goose and grey wavy were breeding in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the marshes, but not in great quantities; the main
body of geese go right out to the coast to lay
their eggs, and do not start for the South till the
end of August.</p>

<p>In the early morning we made a short portage
over a small cascade immediately below the camp,
and found that the river still held its northerly
course through a chain of small lakes connected
by short stretches of bad water. We made one
more portage at mid-day and ran several rather
nasty rapids. After dinner we were obliged to
portage fully a mile to avoid an impassable
reach, and then took more risk than we were
justified in doing with our only canoe by running
a couple of miles of broken water, full of
boulders and with such a heavy sea that we
shipped a good deal of water; luckily we did not
touch anything, and dropped safely into a long
narrow lake, on the east side of which camp was
made for the night. This was the most dangerous
day that we made; as although we always put
ashore to inspect the rapids in case we might discover
a waterfall below, we became emboldened
by success and ran in safety through some places
that we should not have attempted. Back's map
of the river would have been a great help to us,
but neither this nor an account of the previous
journeys that had been made down the stream
was procurable at the fort.</p>

<p>The next day a curious blue haze hung over
everything, closely resembling the smoke of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
forest fire at a distance from the scene of conflagration.
The lake that we had camped on
proved to be about six miles in length, with the
usual rapid at its north end connecting it with
another lake, the size of which we could not at
first determine owing to the murky state of the
air; nor could we at once find its outlet, but by
keeping in a north-easterly direction soon felt
the influence of a current, and found the volume
of water much increased by the junction of a
tributary, which we afterwards discovered came
in from the north-west. On the east side of the
stream, just as it left the lake, we noticed a circle
of flat stones standing on end, evidently put up
by human hands, and on landing discovered unmistakable
signs of a band of Esquimaux having
been encamped there not very long before.
Seven small oval-shaped enclosures, surrounded
by rough turf-heaps six inches in height, had been
the dwelling-places, but we could not determine
whether these low walls were the foundations of
snow-houses or deer-skin lodges; there were several
blackened fireplaces outside, but the fires must
have been very small judging from the charred
stumps of tiny green willow twigs, and we saw
no wood within several miles of the encampment.
The stones propped on end had been used probably
for drying meat, and for tying up the dogs
to keep them from stealing. Bones and horns
of musk-ox and caribou were lying about in every
direction, and their numbers showed that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
must be a favourite camping-place of the Esquimaux;
some of the musk-ox horns had been cut
into rough spoons, and several were found in a
half-finished condition. A flat stone kettle was
picked up with the grease still sticking to it, and
a small piece of copper let into the back, possibly
an arrangement for a handle, showed that
these people are able to work this metal; there
were also a few bone arrow-heads scattered about
in the camp. If any further proof were necessary
to determine what tribe of people had camped here,
it was forthcoming in the form of several pieces
of undressed sealskin with the hair on, and these
seemed to be of greater interest to our crew than
any of the other discoveries; arrow-heads, spoons,
and kettle were dropped in the contemplation of
the skin of an animal they had never seen, and
they instantly demanded a description of the seal.
After we had told them all we knew upon the
subject, we asked their opinion as to the length
of time that the Esquimaux had remained here,
and when they had left. Saltatha, reading the
signs that a white man might miss, came to the
conclusion that they had come here in the autumn,
as was proved by the hard horns of male caribou
lying about, that they had stayed here through
the winter, and left late in the spring with dogs
on the last snow, about six weeks before our arrival.
He thought too that they made a practice
of coming here regularly, in the same manner that
the Yellow Knives come to the head-waters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the river, as the bones appeared to him to have
belonged to animals killed at widely differing
dates. We found hiding-places among the rocks
close to the edge of the river, which had evidently
been used for concealing men engaged in
spearing the swimming caribou. The only weak
point in Saltatha's theory seemed to be the absence
of any carcasses of freshly killed caribou;
but it is possible that the Esquimaux may have
left before the females came out so far, and the
animals would have been later than usual in arriving
here owing to the backward nature of the
spring.</p>

<p>When we had thoroughly inspected everything
we left again down stream, with a swift current
and good water without rapids for eight miles,
where we found another lake running more to the
eastward than the general course of the river; on
the west side of this lake we were obliged to
camp, as a strong head-wind raised too much sea
to travel against, and rain was falling in torrents.
We explored the shore of the lake in hopes of
finding further traces of the Esquimaux, but
made no discoveries of any kind. No musk-ox
were seen this day, but there were enough caribou
to provide food for the party.</p>

<p>With better weather we made an early start in
the morning, the river on leaving the lake bending
a little more to the eastward, with a swift current
for several miles, and two rapids which we
ran in safety. A short distance below the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
rapid the current slackens and the stream gets
rapidly broader, till, with a sudden sweep to the
south-east, the whole length of Beechey Lake
comes open; a long narrow sheet of water, twenty-five
miles in length, and nowhere more than
two in breadth, lying east and west, and forming
a well-defined elbow in the course of the Great
Fish River. With a light fair wind, and a blanket
set for a sail, we ran down the lake and pitched
our lodge on the north shore. Two days were
spent in exploration, but again we failed entirely
to find any signs of the Esquimaux. Towards the
east end of the lake the iron formation shows up
once more, and the country is rough to travel
through. There was a slight difficulty about provisions
at this time as game was scarce, and,
though we fully expected to catch fish in the lake
and put out our net both nights, not a single fish
was taken; just at the critical time, however, a
few female caribou with their young turned up
on their way back to the South, and we were relieved
of all anxiety.</p>

<p>As we had promised our crew that we would
not descend the river beyond Beechey Lake, and it
was already the end of July, orders were reluctantly
given on the third day to start up stream
with the intention of doing a little exploration
to the northward of the old Esquimaux camp, to
see if there was any feasible route from there to
Bathurst Inlet, as there were no signs of these
people having camped in any other place along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the river. It seemed a pity to abandon the voyage
just at the interesting time, after we had got
over all the difficulties of the upper part of the
river and had now only a broad stream to follow,
with a great deal of easy lake-travel, to reach the
Arctic Ocean, and the scene of the final sufferings
of the members of Sir John Franklin's last expedition.
On the other hand, we had no object
in going down to the sea, and there is little pleasure
to be got out of a journey of this kind with
an unwilling and untrustworthy crew; our canoe,
too, which was already leaking badly, would have
been of very little service for sea work.</p>

<p>As far as Beechey Lake the south side of the
Great Fish River is free from any large tributary
streams, so that, if our canoe had been
smashed up in a rapid, and we had been able to
save guns and ammunition, it would have been
easy enough to follow the river on foot; but on
the north side there are several large streams to
be forded, and a long detour might be necessary
to find a spot shallow enough for this purpose.</p>

<p>There was much more enthusiasm displayed
by the Indian portion of the crew on the up-stream
journey, and no encouragement was needful
to get a good day's work done. In the river
stretches the tracking line was used, and three
men at the shore end of it kept the canoe travelling
at a lively pace except in the very strong
water; in mounting the second rapid a mistake
on the part of Noel, our bowsman, caused a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
collision with a rock, and several hours were spent
in putting in a patch of birch-bark. On the second
night we pitched our lodge on the sandy lake
within sight of the Esquimaux camp, and found
a considerable stream coming in from a north-westerly
direction. I cannot find any mention of
this stream in the accounts of the two former
journeys down the river, nor is it marked on the
maps; it was probably unnoticed on both occasions,
as it comes in at the west end of the lake,
out of the course of a canoe passing up or down
the main river.</p>

<p>Mackinlay, Murdo, and myself started on foot
the following morning, to explore this stream for
a couple of days, taking David with us in case
we came across any of his countrymen. The
malcontents were left in charge of the camp, with
orders to kill caribou if any passed, and partially
dry the meat to save the waste of time caused by
having to hunt for our living as we travelled;
they were also to thoroughly gum the canoe, to
stop as much as possible the leaking which was
getting serious.</p>

<p>We struck out along the bank of the stream,
carrying nothing but a gun and a blanket apiece,
and at dinner-time were lucky enough to find a
flock of moulting Canada geese, unable to fly;
four were shot, and two eaten at once, while the
other two were stowed away among the rocks for
use later on. We had a long day's walk through
a pleasant grassy country, and towards evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
crossed an unusually high range of hills through
which the river cañons. Finding a few willows
here, we left our blankets, and walked on along
the bank for an hour or two, finally climbing a
solitary sand-butte at sundown for a last survey
of the country before turning our faces to the
south.</p>

<p>Far away towards the north-west we could
trace the windings of the stream to a ridge of blue
hills, which formed the horizon under the setting
sun. How these blue ridges in the distance tempt
one to push on and see what lies on the far side!
And the experience that nine times out of ten you
would have done better to stay where you were is
never sufficient to overcome this feeling; to this
day I can seldom resist it, although game may be
plentiful at the door of my lodge and everything
that one desires in a wild country is close at hand.
Below us lay a broad valley, so green and fertile
in appearance that we could hardly realise that
for nine months in the year it lay frost-bound
and snow-covered under the rigour of an Arctic
climate. In the middle of this valley, close to the
bank of the stream, was a black object that we
had long ago learnt to recognise at a glance, an
old bull musk-ox feeding in a patch of willow-scrub;
he was sacrificed for our night's rations,
and, loaded with meat and marrow-bones, we returned
to the cañon where we had left our blankets.
There was a distinct twilight, and late in
the night David awoke me to draw my attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
to the first star that we had seen for many
weeks. "See," he said, "a star already; it is past
middle summer, and we have not yet seen the sun
all night." It was the first summer he had ever
spent without seeing the midnight sun, as, since he
had been left at the Peel River Fort by a band
of Esquimaux who come there annually to trade,
he had passed his life within the Arctic circle.</p>

<p>The only signs that we saw of people having
travelled along this valley were occasional cache-marks
made by piling up a heap of small stones
in a conspicuous position, to denote the carcass
of an animal hidden in the rocks close by; but
it seems such an easy route and leads so nearly
in the direction of Bathurst Inlet, the nearest
point on the sea-coast, that it is probably used
regularly by wandering bands of Esquimaux on
their way to and from their inland hunting-ground.</p>

<p>This was the end of our voyage of discovery,
though I should have liked to have pushed on another
day or two; but we wanted a small canoe
to be certain of reaching the coast, which must
have been within sixty miles of us, as there are
sure to be many lakes to cross <i>en route</i>, and making
long detours on foot would be an endless
task. The fine weather also had broken, and
heavy showers of rain came driving in front of
the north wind, while the rest of our crew that
had remained with the canoe were not too trustworthy,
and, with the exception of Saltatha, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
whom both Mackinlay and myself had great confidence,
were quite capable of leaving us to find
our way out of the country on foot. We had to
content ourselves with the hope that in a future
summer, with an earlier season and a better crew,
we might find an opportunity of exploring thoroughly
this promising valley in the Barren
Ground. But now I must turn my attention to
my long journey of seventeen hundred miles,
mostly up-stream, to cross the Rocky Mountains
by the head-waters of the Peace River before the
winter set in; and even if I could manage this
there were still many hundred miles of mountain
and forest to be crossed before I saw the shores
of the Pacific and the abodes of civilization.</p>

<p>When we reached the lodge we found that the
Indians had made a stupid slaughter of caribou,
and, not contented with taking as much meat as
we could carry, had been recklessly killing the
females and young that were now passing in
great numbers. The love of killing seems deeply
rooted in the nature of most men, but the Yellow
Knives have it more fully developed than other
people. This indiscriminate slaughter is especially
culpable in a land where ammunition is scarce,
and not to be replaced when wasted by needless
firing.</p>

<p>The next morning we picked out of our trading-stock
a few presents to be left in the Esquimaux
camp, as a sign that there were people in
the interior willing to be on friendly terms with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the people of the coast. Knives, axes, beads, and
files, a couple of hand-mirrors, a few strips of
red cloth, and a flannel shirt or two were stuffed
into a copper kettle, which would be itself the
biggest prize of all. On lifting the lid, the first
object to meet the eye of the wondering Esquimaux
would be the photograph of the Protestant
missionary at Fort Resolution, which David had
been keeping among his small stock of treasures;
it was a photograph of a Church of England
clergyman, in clerical costume, and should certainly
give the Esquimaux a favourable idea of
the style of man who had visited their camping-place.
We also put in a note asking anyone who
might read it to let us know in what manner
it had come to hand, as it is uncertain whether
these scattered bands of Esquimaux ever visit
the Hudson's Bay Company's summer trading-post
on Marble Island, which lies a great distance
away at the mouth of Chesterfield Inlet, or
whether they only know of the white men by
hearsay from other tribes that trade annually
with the Company. The kettle was carefully
stowed in one of the pits made for watching the
swimming caribou, and a canoe-pole, bearing a
gaudy cotton handkerchief for a flag, planted
alongside to attract attention. Everybody tried
their handiwork at sketching our story with burnt
sticks on the conspicuous flat rocks close to the
river: there was a picture of a canoe, with seven
upright black lines supposed to represent seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
men; another of a Yellow Knife and an Esquimau
(though the artist could not say which
was which) shaking hands with the greatest affection;
while David was certainly entitled to the
first prize for a bloodthirsty sketch of a misshapen
musk-ox, with a thin black line, again supposed
to be a man, transfixed on the point of his horn.
When we thought we had represented everything
to perfection, we turned our backs on the land
of the Esquimaux and plodded away up stream,
tracking and portaging in the river-stretches, and
paddling through the lakes which are always a
great help in mounting a stream.</p>

<p>We now came in for a spell of really bad
weather, which made the uphill work very laborious.
A heavy unceasing downpour of rain,
and sometimes sleet, continued day after day,
accompanied by strong winds. The men all
worked well and without much grumbling, although
we were never dry and in many places
the tracking had to be done waist-deep in water;
at night we slept in our wet clothes, on the wet
ground, rolled up in our sopping blankets. This
is the killing weather, and one needs perfect
health to resist its effects; the dry cold of a northern
winter is child's play in comparison. Saltatha,
who had hurt himself by a nasty fall while
carrying a heavy load over a portage, broke down
completely at this time, and was unable to work
during the rest of the trip. We could do nothing
for him, as there was no medicine of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
kind in the outfit, and he had to take his chance
with the rest. I think he came very near dying
while we were running down Lockhart's River;
he lost all strength and was spitting blood freely
for a fortnight, but ultimately recovered in a
miraculous manner. We worked long days tracking
up-stream, but were continually delayed by
having to patch up the canoe every time she
touched a rock; it was just as well we did not
go down to the mouth of the river, for she would
certainly not have stood another three weeks'
work of this kind. Another trouble was the
scarcity of moccasins, which were completely
worn out by a single day's walk on the sharp
rocks along the river's bank.</p>

<p>In eight days we reached Musk-ox Lake, and,
finding the wind too strong to paddle against,
we put ashore on the east side and took advantage
of a little sunshine to thoroughly dry all our belongings.
From this camp we saw the last musk-ox,
and, crossing the bay with a canoe, went in
pursuit as our meat supply was short. Some of
the guns were posted, and others tried to drive
the animals, but we made a mess of the hunt
and the whole band escaped; my last remembrance
of the animals that I had started out a year before
on purpose to kill, being a stern view of a
grand old bull disappearing at a gallop over a
ridge, and a puff of dust just behind him, marking
the spot where a badly aimed rifle-bullet had
struck the ground. A caribou, however, supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
us with meat, but we had some trouble in picking
him up, as he was killed in the water and it was
no easy matter to tow his carcass ashore against
the gale of wind that was raging. Mackinlay
and myself for once got ahead of the wolverines
on this occasion. We saw three coming our
way before they saw us, and, lying behind a rock,
bowled them all over; a right and left at wolverines
is seldom brought about in a lifetime, but
it is very satisfactory when one thinks of the
stolen <i>caches</i> and consequent hard times that these
wily brutes are responsible for.</p>

<p>From the south end of the lake I walked ahead
with Mackinlay, starting early in the morning,
and at mid-day sighted three lodges on the Aylmer
Lake divide. We fired a signal-shot which
brought everybody out, and we were soon surrounded
by Capot Blanc's brigade, and deluged
with questions as to what had happened and why
we had come back alone; for surely something
evil had taken place in the country that always
slopes downhill. With our small command of the
Yellow Knife language, and plenty of signs, we
made them understand that the canoe was by this
time at the first lake, and the water was so low
in the river that it would be necessary to portage
the whole distance. All the available men and
women went to help our crew to carry the loads,
and by sundown our lodge was once more planted
by the water that finds its way to the Great Slave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Lake and runs a course of a thousand miles before
falling into the Arctic Sea.</p>

<p>It took half a day to settle accounts with the
Indians who had been working for us on our way
up to Musk-ox Lake, while the women were busy
gumming the canoe and getting her in order for
the run down Lockhart's River. A good proportion
of the wages due were paid out of the remainder
of our trading-stock that had been intended
for the Esquimaux if we had met them.
The box that contained this small supply of goods
had been an object of strife the whole time. The
Indians had the strongest objection to any of the
products of the Grand Pays passing through their
country being given to strangers, and we had
been careful not to let them see the gaudy contents
of the box, or we should have been troubled
with the constant begging that the Yellow
Knives think will eventually gain them the object
they desire. Imagination had run high as to
the contents of the fairy casket, and there was a
great rush when it was announced that any of
the men to whom wages were due might take
what they fancied. They had seen pressed bales
of blankets landed at the fort on the arrival of
the yearly outfit from Winnipeg, and had been
surprised at the number of blankets that could be
squeezed into a small space; there was an idea
prevalent that our box had been packed on the
same principle, and might contain an abundant
supply of all the good things that only the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
men know how to make. Some disappointment
was shown when it turned out that we had only
been speaking the truth in answering their petitions
by telling them we had such a small stock
that nothing could be spared. The trade went off
to the satisfaction of both sides; the Indians obtained
the trinkets so dear to their vanity, and
we lightened our load for the numerous portages
that lay between us and the Great Slave Lake.
There was some question as to what it was best
to do with Saltatha; whether to leave him here
with his friends, or to let him take his chance of
the canoe journey to the fort, where medicine
could possibly be obtained; at his own request we
decided on the latter course, and during the first
few days his health seemed to improve.</p>

<p>The route that we were now to take was the
same that Back and Anderson had both chosen,
following the Lockhart's River down-stream
through the immense lakes that lie in its course,
gradually bending to the south-west, and avoiding
the impassable obstructions in the lower part
of the river by portaging through a chain of lakes,
the last of which is only three miles distant from
the north-east end of the Great Slave Lake. The
boat was to meet us on August 1st, and as it was
already several days past that date we determined
to travel our best, although there was a
chance of getting windbound in any of the big
lakes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p>Late in the afternoon, with a great improvement
in the weather, our canoe was afloat on Aylmer
Lake (known to the Indians as the Lake of
the Big Cliffs), over which she had been dragged
on a dog-sleigh five weeks before. The following
evening we passed into the short stretch of
river that leaves its east end, and camped late on
the south shore of Clinton Golden Lake, or, as
the Yellow Knives call it, the Lake where the
Caribou swim among the Ice. The vast body of
water opened out before us into apparently a
perfect circle, and now for the first time we were
in doubt as to our course, for there was nothing
to indicate the point at which the river leaves
the far end of the lake; the east shore was invisible
from the slight hill behind our camp, although
it was a clear bright morning. We had
two maps with us, one, the latest issued under
the Dominion Government's directions, and the
other, an old 1834 map of Arrowsmith's which
we had discovered at the fort; they offered very
divergent opinions as to the general lay of Lockhart's
River, and it says little for later geographical
research that the older map should have been
by far the more accurate of the two.</p>

<p>We put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span> out at three o'clock in the morning to
take advantage of calm weather to make the
crossing of the lake, and after paddling about
eight miles went ashore on an island to cook
breakfast and reconnoitre. From here we could
see the faint outline of land to the east, and made
out that what had appeared a circle consisted in
reality of three enormous bays, one heading east,
one south-east, and the third south-west. Which
was the right one to take? An appeal to Saltatha
and Noel, who were supposed to have local knowledge,
produced no results; Noel said he thought
the east bay was the right one, while Saltatha,
pointing south-west, said perhaps that was the
correct course to follow. It ended in our taking
the middle bay, and, for the benefit of the next
party that crosses this lake, I may state that there
is a peculiar conical butte lying roughly twenty
miles south-east from this island; it is just visible
above the horizon, and is a capital leading mark
to bring a canoe into a long narrow arm of the
lake, which afterwards broadens again into a
huge round sheet of water, and here, by keeping
close to the east shore for five miles, the entrance
to the river will be found. It was in great uncertainty
that we headed our frail vessel across the
broad traverse with a blanket set in front of a
light fair wind; at noon we again put ashore on
an island, and, killing a caribou, made a long halt
for dinner. We climbed to the highest point of
land but could make nothing out of our survey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and continued coasting along the island till we
reached its south end, and then found ourselves
in the channel I have mentioned. No current
was noticeable, and we pushed on through the
winding waterway, in fear that it might be a <i>cul
de sac</i> and we should have to turn back and try
our luck in some other direction. On landing,
however, we saw a sheet of water ahead of us,
so broad that the far shore was below the horizon,
and, on passing out of the channel we had been
following, pitched camp on the east side of the
lake, still uncertain as to where the river lay.
Very early in the morning we were under way
again, and followed the land to make sure that
we did not pass the opening of the river, if indeed
we were anywhere near it. About six
o'clock there came a shout from the bowsman,
that he saw a pole planted among the rocks
ashore, and the canoe at once began to feel the
influence of a slight current. Rounding a low
point, a reach of strong running water lay before
us, and we landed to see what was the meaning
of the pole. A broken piece of <i>babiche</i> hanging
from it told the old story of a rifled <i>cache</i>, another
evidence of the wolverine's handiwork.</p>

<p>Among the Indians who had come to the fort
during the winter to trade fur was a hunter generally
known by the name of Pierre the Fool,
though it seems hard to understand how one of
the most intelligent Indians in the country of
the Great Slave Lake had earned this <i>soubriquet</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Pierre had been much interested in our expedition.
Every summer he pitched his lodge where
the river leaves the lake in which the caribou
swim among the ice, to make dried meat to sell
at the fort; his hunt this year had been successful,
and, when he broke up his camp, he had faithfully
kept his promise to leave us a <i>cache</i> of pounded
meat and grease, but the wolverines had reaped
the benefit. Just below the camp we saw plain
evidence of the slaughter he had made among the
swimming caribou; what we took at first for a
bunch of remarkably big willow sticks proved to
be the horns of fifty or sixty bucks, lying in shallow
water at the edge of the stream; and enough
meat to keep an Indian family for a year, if properly
cured, was rotting in the sun.</p>

<p>After a mile of strong running stream the river
falls into another lake, and immediately makes a
sharp bend to the south-west, and, during the rest
of the descent, we travelled in that direction with
little variation till we reached the Great Slave
Lake. Saltatha now began to recognise the country,
and there was no more doubt about the way;
but had we been left to our own judgment, we
should have certainly gone wrong in this first lake,
as there is a promising bay heading in to the
south. None of the maps show this bend in the
stream at all correctly, nor do they take any notice
of the next lake, the Indians' Ptarmigan
Lake, a large sheet of water fully twenty miles
in length, which Pierre the Fool afterwards told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
us lies within a short portage of the west bay of
Clinton Golden Lake.</p>

<p>We now fell in again with the big herds of
caribou. For the last few weeks we had only
seen enough to provide us with meat, but here
they were in their thousands, and I am sorry to
say that our crew did far too much killing, during
the short spell of bad weather which forced
us to camp on Ptarmigan Lake. The excuse was
that the hides were now at their best for coats
and robes; but even so, far more were killed than
could be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>We made rather a risky passage down the lake
in front of a strong wind and heavy sea, and at
the west end found an ugly rapid six hundred
yards in length: the cargo was portaged and the
canoe run light in safety; and, after crossing a
short lake, another rapid was negotiated in the
same manner. In this second portage stood a
solitary pine-tree, round which we all crowded
as in welcome of an old friend after our long
journey in a woodless country. Just below there
was an impassable rapid, the only real impediment
to navigation from the head of Mackay
Lake to the foot of Artillery Lake, a distance of
four hundred miles. Below the portage we ran
five or six miles down a steady swift current,
occasionally widening out into a small lake, with
caribou continually swimming across the river
ahead of the canoe, and late at night camped on
the edge of a huge lake with a clear horizon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the west. This proved to be Artillery Lake, and
at four o'clock next morning we were running
down the south shore, in front of a gale of wind
with our smallest blanket set for a sail. The
day was much colder, with a few flakes of snow
flying, and everybody was pleased to put ashore
in a clump of pine-trees at dinner-time; the wind
moderated towards evening, and, crossing to the
north shore, we camped once again in the strong
woods. The timber line is much more clearly defined
here than on the other routes by which I
approached the Barren Ground; the outlying
clumps of pines extend to a very short distance,
and their growth ceases entirely within seventy
miles of the Great Slave Lake. If it should ever
again prove necessary to reach the Arctic Sea
by way of the Great Fish River, Artillery Lake
would, in my opinion, be by far the best place
at which to build light boats for the voyage; the
timber is quite large enough, and only one portage
has to be made to reach the Aylmer Lake divide.</p>

<p>The next morning we reached the end of Artillery
Lake, which we reckoned roughly at forty-five
miles in length, and passed into a narrow
channel with hardly any current. Towards midday
a couple of small canoes appeared ahead of
us, and the usual formalities of saluting ensued.
When they came alongside the occupants were
asked for the news, and they informed us that the
burnt Indian was drowned, that the caribou had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
been passing more thickly than ever known before,
and that the fort boat had not yet arrived
at the appointed meeting-place. The burnt Indian
seems to have been badly out of luck. He
had rolled into his camp-fire during a fit, and
was found with his feet burnt off; after being
doctored by the missionary for many months, and
cured as far as it was possible to cure such a case,
the cripple had left the fort with some of his relations
to get back among the caribou, but on the
second day out was drowned by capsizing his
canoe. We could not account for the non-arrival
of the boat, as we ourselves were already a
fortnight later than the day agreed upon for
meeting.</p>

<p>Round the next bend of the stream were six
lodges, and the first greeting we received was
from old Syene, the Medicine Man. There was
no doubt that the caribou had been passing, as
the children and dogs were rolling fat, and an unmistakable
air of plethora from much feasting
hung over the camp. Only four days before there
had been one of those big slaughters, which one
would think could not fail in a short time to exterminate
the caribou. A large band had been
seen to start from the opposite bank, and was
soon surrounded by seven hunting-canoes; the
spears were kept going as long as there was life
to take, with the result that three hundred and
twenty-six carcasses were hauled ashore, and fully
two hundred of these left to rot in the shallow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
water. Every lodge was full of meat and grease
in various forms, and there would be a cargo for
the boat to take back to the fort. Pierre the Fool,
who was camped here, was in great form, and at
once presented us with a bunch of smoked tongues
and a bladder of marrow grease. He gave us a
great deal of information about the country eastward
of Clinton Golden Lake, and in a much more
intelligent manner than the usual Indian method
of constant repetition; he told us there were
fewer lakes in that direction than in any other
part of the Barren Ground that he had visited,
but he was always obliged to take a small canoe
with him, to cross a big stream running in a
southerly direction, three days' easy travel from
Clinton Golden Lake. Once, when he had pushed
out farther than usual, he had seen smoke in the
distance, and came upon a camp that the Esquimaux
from Hudson's Bay had just left; they had
been cutting wood for their sleighs in a clump
of well-grown pines, and Pierre, who shares the
dread which every Yellow Knife has of the Coast
tribes, had been afraid to follow them. From
the fact of his having seen the pine-trees, which
are said not to extend far from the salt water
of Hudson's Bay, he must have been within a
short distance of the coast.</p>

<p>On the day after our arrival in the encampment
a general movement was made; the lodges
were thrown down, and the women and dogs
received heavy loads to carry to the Great Slave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Lake. Lockhart's River on leaving Artillery
Lake becomes a wild torrent, falling several hundred
feet in twenty miles, and is quite useless
for navigation, so we had to make use of a chain
of lakes, eight in number, lying to the south of
the stream. This is by far the prettiest part of
the country that I saw in the North, and it was
looking its best under the bright sunshine that
continued till we reached the fort. Scattering
timber, spruce and birch, clothed the sloping
banks down to the sandy shores of the lakes;
berries of many kinds grew in profusion; the
portages were short and down hill; and caribou
were walking the ridges and swimming the lakes
in every direction. A perfect northern fairyland
it was, and it seemed hard to believe that winter
and want could ever penetrate here; but on the
shore of a lovely blue lake Pierre the Fool pointed
out a spot where the last horrors of death and
cannibalism had been enacted within his memory.
Sometimes a column of smoke would be seen
ahead, and we paddled by a lodge where the fat
sleepy children were revelling in the abundance
of grease. Late on the second day a white object
on the shore attracted general attention: "It
is a wolf, a white caribou; no, a man, a man in
a white shirt,&mdash;it must be one of the boat's crew";
and so it proved to be. The white shirt was a
libel, but the clean canvas jumper quite deserved
the admiration it had received, especially in contrast
with our own rags. The boat had arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
from Fort Resolution in charge of François
Mandeville, another brother of Michel the fort
interpreter. François had been alarmed at not
finding us at the meeting-place, and had immediately
dispatched four of the crew in a large canoe,
with a supply of tea, tobacco, and flour, to
ascend the river in hopes of finding us. But the
relief party had come across the fresh tracks of
caribou in the first portage; it was long since they
had tasted meat, so the canoe was put down in
the woods, and the "big masters," who were supposed
to be lost in the Barren Ground, were forgotten.
The man we met had come on to see
some relations who were camped among the lakes,
and, as he was discovered to be possessed of tobacco,
we made him share up, and sat on the
beach enjoying the first smoke for many days,
and hearing the accounts of what little events had
happened during a short summer on the Great
Slave Lake. But it was getting late, and we still
had the longest portage to make. At the end
of the last lake we abandoned the canoe that had
done me such good service on two long journeys,
and with loads on our backs followed the
well-worn trail that the Indians have used from
time immemorial as a route to their hunting-grounds.
A natural pass with a steep descent led
between the rough broken hills on each side, and
a three-mile walk brought us within sight of the
waters of the big lake. Below us, close by the
edge of the bay, there were already several lodges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
planted, and over a white tent floated the old red
ensign bearing in the corner the letters H. B. C.
so well known throughout the whole dominion of
Canada. A shot from the last ridge aroused the
encampment, and soon a general fusillade took
place; a fleet of canoes, running with blankets set
to a fair wind far across the bay, took up the
firing and headed for the shore, while every Indian
within sound of gun-shot hurried to hear the
news and join in the trading which was sure to
take place on our arrival.</p>

<p>Here we found everything that a man in the
wilds longs for, flour, bacon, tea, tobacco, sugar,
a packet of letters from England written many
months before, and a bottle of brandy, the first
"fire-water" that had come our way for a year.
Women and dogs heavily loaded with bales of
meat and bladders of grease kept dropping in
from across the portage; a dance was set on foot
and kept up all night round the huge camp fires,
while the tall pine-trees looked down on a scene
of feasting and revelry such as had probably
never been known on the shores of this pleasant
bay.</p>

<p>Poor Saltatha, who had been very bad for the
last week, crawled into our lodge late at night,
and threw himself down on a blanket in a state
of utter exhaustion. In spite of the best law in
Canada, which forbids a white man to give an
Indian any intoxicating drink, under penalty of a
$200 fine, I determined to try if brandy could do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
him any good. Saltatha had never tasted the
strong water, but had heard much of its wonderful
qualities, and made no objection to trying the
cure. I gave him a small dose, but it had a
wonderful effect; his eyes became round and big,
and once again he started the dismal chant that
he had been so fond of during our musk-ox hunt
last winter. He was hopelessly drunk, and, when
he was seized with a violent fit of coughing and
his head fell on the blanket like a dead man's, I
thought I had made a sad mess of my doctoring.
Early in the morning I got up to see if he was
dead, and was relieved to find him much better
and keen for some more brandy, which I refused;
he had had very pleasant dreams he said, and the
pain had gone from his chest to his head. From
that time he improved in health, his strength came
back rapidly, and when I left the fort a week later,
he looked as well as ever.</p>

<p>Two days were spent in trading for the meat
which kept coming in, and during this time we
sent out a hunting-party to kill fresh meat, which
we hoped would keep till we reached the fort if
we made a good passage. At Resolution times
were very hard; few fish were being caught, and
the return of the boat was anxiously expected.
Many caribou were killed, and our ship was well
loaded with fresh meat, besides over three thousand
pounds of dried meat, two hundred pounds
of grease, bunches of tongues, coils of <i>babiche</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and sinew, and a little fur that had been killed
during the spring.</p>

<p>The Indians all left on the evening of the second
day, and early the following morning we put
to sea in a flat calm. Before leaving we went
through the ceremony of cutting a lop-stick, as is
the fashion of the North, to commemorate our
expedition. A conspicuous pine was chosen, a
man sent aloft to lop off the lower branches, while
Mackinlay and myself cut our names on the
trunk; then everybody discharged their guns at
the tree, and the performance was ended. Often
in the lonely waterways of the Northern country
one sees a lop-stick showing far ahead on the
bank, and reads a name celebrated in the annals
of the Hudson's Bay Company or in the history
of Arctic exploration. These lop-sticks are
easily distinguished landmarks, well known to
the <i>voyageurs</i>, and many an appointment has
been kept at Campbell's, Macdougal's, or Macfarlane's
tree. In giving directions to a stranger it
is hopeless to describe the points and bends of a
monotonous river highway, but a lop-stick does
the duty of a signpost and at once settles the question
of locality.</p>

<p>Two hundred miles of the Great Slave Lake
lay between us and the fort, but a steady wind
came from the north, and the shallow-draught
York boat ran in front of it so well that on the
fourth night we camped on the Mission Island
within a couple of miles of Fort Resolution. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
worse boat for the navigation of the lake could
hardly be imagined. A huge square sail, set on
a mast shipped right amidships, does good work
so long as the wind is abaft the beam; but when
a head-wind springs up, too strong to row against,
it is a case of hauling ashore on the beach, as no
anchor is carried. Steep cliffs on a lee shore have
to be carefully avoided, for it is impossible to
propel such a vessel to windward in a heavy sea.
On the present occasion, however, we were in
great luck, and I never remember a more pleasant
voyage in a sailing-boat. A run up the English
Channel in a well-found yacht, with fair wind
and sunshine, is enjoyable enough; but there are
seldom any blankets to lie about in on deck, and
there is always some stray peak or jib-halliard
that wants pulling on, besides continual threats
of setting or stowing a topsail, which prevents
your settling down into a comfortable position.
Here we had nothing to worry us; the wind blew
fair, and we lay in our blankets, smoking and
looking at the land, as the boat glided along the
narrow blue lanes, among islands that the foot
of white man had never pressed. Four times a
day we put ashore to boil the kettle, and at night
slept by the side of a huge fire in the thick pine-woods;
darkness lasted many hours now, and prevented
navigation among the countless islands
and outlying rocks. On the fourth day we crossed
the Grand Traverse, and, leaving the Ile de Pierre
after nightfall, ran for Mission Island with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
strong wind blowing in from the open lake.
Crossing the mouth of the big river was rather
risky work in the dark, as the sandy battures ran
far off to sea and the waves were breaking heavily
in the shallow water; the sounding-pole gave
only four feet in one place, but we ran across
without touching, and at midnight camped at the
back of Mission Island.</p>

<p>The sun was just rising on Sunday, August
the 24th, when we ran the boat on the beach in
front of Fort Resolution, and a glance at the
faces that gathered round told us that living had
been none too good, and that a man is sometimes
better off among the caribou than depending
upon an uncertain fishery for a livelihood. With
all thanks to priest and parson, Indian and half-breed,
for the kind welcome they gave us, I noticed
many an eye glancing furtively at our rich
cargo from the land of plenty; and the rejoicings
that day may be attributed equally to joy at our
safe arrival and to the influence of a feast of
fresh meat after many weeks of short allowance.</p>

<p>I could afford to make only a short stay at
Resolution, as the season was far advanced, and
I had to start at once to avoid the chance of being
caught by the winter during my long journey.
Of the three routes that might enable me to
do this I should have preferred the ascent of the
Liard River, which falls into the Mackenzie at
Fort Simpson. From its head-waters at Dease
Lake, in the once celebrated mining district of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Cassiar, the Pacific Coast is reached at Fort
Wrangel in Southern Alaska without difficulty;
but the Liard itself is full of terrors, even for the
hardy <i>voyageurs</i> of the North, and although Mr.
Camsell offered every inducement to men to accompany
me he was unable to get together a crew.
Formerly the Company had an establishment at
Fort Halket on the west branch of the Liard,
but the difficulties of conveying supplies, and the
frequent occurrence of starvation, made it a hard
post to maintain; finally a boat's crew were
drowned by a capsize in one of the worst rapids,
and the fort was abandoned. The Athabasca I
had seen, and not caring to go over old ground I
decided on ascending the Peace River to its head-waters
in the neighbourhood of Macleod's Lake
on the west side of the Rocky Mountains, and,
crossing the small divide, to run down the Fraser
River to Quesnelle a small town on the southern
edge of the Caribou Gold Fields of Northern
British Columbia.</p>

<p>The <i>Wrigley</i> had made her last up-stream voyage
for the year, and was daily expected from
Fort Smith. I was thus obliged to depend on
canoe travelling to reach Chipeweyan on the
Athabasca Lake, some three hundred miles distant;
if we had arrived at the fort ten days earlier
I could have saved much valuable time by
making this part of my journey by steamer.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of frequent experience that
it is better to leave a fort overnight, even if camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
be made within a couple of miles, than to trust to
an early start in the morning, it was after sundown
on the 26th when I said good-bye to Resolution,
not without a feeling of regret, and the
hope of seeing at some future time the place
where I had been so well treated. There are few
spots in the world in which one can live for a
year without making some friends, and when I
left this lonely trading-post there were many faces
on the beach that I should like to see again. Saltatha
was the last man to shake hands with me
as I stepped into the canoe; he tried to extract a
promise from me to come back the next summer
for another expedition in the Barren Ground, and
was much disappointed when I told him that I
certainly could not return for two years, and perhaps
not even then. No need to feel pity for the
people left behind, although I was going to civilization
and all the good things that this word
comprises. A man who has spent much time
under the influence of the charm which the North
exercises over everybody wants nothing better
than to be allowed to finish his life in the peace
and quietness which reign by the shores of the
Great Slave Lake. Ask the priest, when you
meet him struggling against a head-wind and
driving snow on his way to some Indian encampment,
whether he ever sighs for his sunny
France. "No," he will tell you; "here I have
everything I want and nothing to distract my
thoughts; I enjoy perfect health, and I feel no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
desire to go back to the worries of the great
world." So it is with the fur-trader; the mysterious
charm has a firm hold on him, and if he is
in charge of a post where provisions are fairly
plentiful and the Indians not troublesome he has
a happy life indeed. I was sorry to have missed
seeing the Mackenzie River, La Grande Rivière
en Bas, as they call it at Fort Resolution, but to
do this meant spending another winter and another
summer in the country, and I could not
afford the time.</p>

</a><span class="caption"><br />Starting Up the Peace River</span>
</div>

<p>The first evening out from the fort we camped
near the mouth of the Slave River, on the same
spot where I had spent a night with King Beaulieu
and his family more than a year before. My
crew now consisted of Murdo Mackay and three
half-breeds, while Mackinlay, who had proved
such a trusty companion during our summer
journey, was to accompany me till we met the
steamer. This happened the next morning, and
after an hour of hurried questions and answers,
and farewells to men who seemed more like old
friends than comparative strangers whom I had
met once the year before, the <i>Wrigley</i> put her
head down-stream, and we continued our voyage
through the wilderness of pines, cotton-wood, and
willow.</p>

<p>Pierre Beaulieu was captain and guide of the
canoe, and a right good traveller he proved to be;
no lying snug in your blankets in the early morning,
but breakfast in black darkness, and the paddles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
or tracking-line in full swing at the first sign
of the coming day. Sometimes he would put
ashore and start us off through the woods, with
canoe and cargo on our backs, to drop on the
river again at the end of the portage, and find that
we had saved many miles of laborious up-stream
work by cutting across a bend of the river. The
tracking till we reached Fort Smith was bad, as
the banks were usually soft muddy sand, while
the land-slips had sent so many trees into the
river that it was often easier to paddle against
the stream than to pass the line round the obstruction.
Ducks and geese were plentiful
enough, but Mackinlay had been liberal in the
matter of provisions for our voyage, so we only
took the most tempting shots, but if it had been
necessary we could have made our own living
without difficulty. Early on the sixth day we
came in sight of Fort Smith, and found Mr.
Flett in charge, with the house much improved
and made fairly comfortable in readiness for the
winter; but there was no time to be spared, and
the next day saw us driving across the portage in
a waggon to take a fresh crew to Chipeweyan.
No canoe was available, but José Beaulieu, another
of King's numerous brothers, lent us a skiff,
which answered the purpose well enough. Mr.
Flett took the opportunity of going up to headquarters,
and enlivened the journey with many
stories of over forty years' experience in the
North. Among the new crew was a deaf and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
dumb half-breed, a capital worker and always
good-tempered, in spite of the cold drenching rain
that continued till we reached Chipeweyan; some
of his conversations by signs were very amusing,
and one could almost wish that all these boatmen
were deaf and dumb to avoid the constant chatter
which they keep up round the camp-fire when
they know that you understand them. One day
we made a splendid run in front of a gale of north
wind, but nearly came to grief through our steersman's
recklessness in trying to force the boat over
a rapid under canvas; she took a sheer in the swirl
of an eddy, and the sail jibbed with such violence
that we were within an inch of a capsize. Provisions
ran short on the last day, but just as we
were talking of camping early and going after
duck for supper a little black bear turned up on
the bank; I was lucky enough to kill it, and we
enjoyed a royal feast of fat bear's meat instead of
a night's starvation. On the fourth day we entered
the Athabasca Lake, and forced our way
to the fort against a strong head-wind; it was
another Sunday arrival, and we did not show to
advantage in comparison with the bright dresses
and gaudy belts and moccasins of the dwellers
at the chief post of the Athabasca district. A little
snow was whitening the ground, the goose-hunt
was at its height, and the array of nets
showed plainly enough that it was time to make
preparation for the Fall fishing. Dr. Mackay was
away inspecting Fort Vermillion on the Lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Peace River, and would not be back for several
days. An unexpected difficulty now turned up;
there was no crew forthcoming for the next part
of my journey, and everybody advised me to take
the ordinary route by the Athabasca River. However,
two of my Fort Smith crew, José and Dummy,
finally agreed to go to Vermillion, although
neither of them had been there before, and Murdo,
who was very anxious to accompany me
across the mountains, obtained leave to come with
me till we should meet Dr. Mackay on Peace
River; if he could get extended leave from the
head officer of the District he was to come right
through.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p>By this time it was well on in September, and
eight hundred miles had to be travelled to reach
the Rocky Mountains and when these were
sighted there were still two hundred miles to
MacLeod's Lake, the farthest point I could reasonably
hope to reach by open water. The first
night we camped in the Quatre Fourches, the
channel connecting the lake with the main stream
of Peace River. The banks were thickly peopled
with Indians and half-breeds, drying whitefish
which were being taken in marvellous numbers;
white and grey wavies and ducks of many kinds
were flying overhead in large flocks, and rising
in front of the canoe at every bend of the stream;
plovers and other wading birds were screaming
over the marshes, and I noticed a good many
snipe; but who would fire a charge of ammunition
at such a wretched little mouthful when
geese were plentiful? Without going out of
our way to hunt, we could have loaded the canoe
with wild-fowl, but of course only killed as many
as we required for food.</p>

<p>At the end of the Quatre Fourches we passed
into the main stream of Peace River, and, with
a sharp westward turn, commenced our ascent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
of the easiest of all the Northern waterways.
From its junction with the Slave River to the
first range of the Rocky Mountains, with only
the obstruction of the shute some forty miles
below Fort Vermillion, its course is navigable
throughout for a light-draught steamer, and, but
for this shute, would be an invaluable route for
supplying the Hudson's Bay Company's upper
river-posts.</p>

<p>The lower reaches of the river present exactly
the same appearance as the country we had
passed through in ascending the Slave River; a
broad stream with low sandy banks, densely timbered,
with often a huge sand-bar, the resting-place
of many geese, stretching far out into the
stream. We were rather handicapped by not
knowing the river and missing the best tracking;
an old hand would have known all the correct
crossings to take advantage of an easy bank to
track from, or an eddy to paddle in. Nor could
we well risk the short cuts, as a promising channel
would often end in dry sand instead of
running through into the river, or turn out to
be the mouth of a tributary stream. After our
usual halt for dinner on the third day we saw a
canoe coming down stream, and, crossing over,
found that it was Dr. Mackay on his way from
Vermillion; both canoes put ashore and we had
the usual cup of tea and an hour's yarn together.
The Doctor was anxious to get back to Chipeweyan,
to begin his Fall fishing and make every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
possible preparation for keeping up the food-supply
for the winter; I had no time to spare
either, and darkness must have found us camping
many miles apart. These stray meetings in
the wilderness are always a pleasant recollection,
and on first returning to civilization one is
surprised at the manner in which people pass
each other with a nod, till one realises the fact
that there are too many people about for a more
lengthy salute. Murdo obtained leave to come
with me across the mountains, subject to the
condition that he was to return in the spring
if he received orders to that effect from headquarters
at Winnipeg.</p>

<p>The same evening we hauled up an insignificant
rapid, caused by a contraction in the channel;
a limestone formation, with many fossils,
shows up here for a few miles of the river's
course, and is noticeable again at the shutes and
in several spots along the river. We broke the
canoe rather badly in mounting this rapid, and
during the rest of our journey to Vermillion had
to bale out frequently. Day after day we followed
the winding course of the river, which
bends and doubles on itself through the flat
country, and at last made out a landmark in the
Caribou Mountains, lying to the north and
stretching in that direction as far as we could
see: an inviting range of hills, clear of timber
on the slope, and their round summits sparsely
dotted with pines; a favourite hunting-ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
for the Indians of Vermillion, but none of the
white men of whom I made inquiry seemed to
have any knowledge of the extent or nature of
this solitary range, rising so conspicuously from
the dead level of muskeg and pine forest.</p>

<p>Just as we were starting on the tenth morning
a light puff of west wind brought us the
first sound of a distant roar that we knew must
be caused by the shute, and a couple of hours'
tracking brought us to a small Company's trading-post,
known as Little Red River, from a
stream bearing that name which here joins the
Peace River from the south. The establishment
was deserted, although it was to be kept open
during the winter; so we passed on and soon
came in sight of a low white wall of water extending
across the whole width of the river. Dr.
Mackay had told me to make the portage close
under the fall on the south side, or we should
have been at a loss to find the only place where
it is possible to take the canoe out of the water.
In a strong running current, with the spray falling
over her bow, we put alongside a ledge of rock
six feet above us, and two men, standing on a submerged
ledge, not without difficulty passed everything
up to the others above; the distance to
carry was very short, and we were soon afloat
again above the fall. The shute is not more than
eight feet in height, but is of course a complete
barrier to navigation. I think the scene from
the south bank is one of the most beautiful in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the whole course of the loveliest of rivers. It
was a bright afternoon when we made the portage,
and the white broken water of the cascade
showed in strong contrast to the broad blue
stretches above and below; several rocky, pine-covered
islands stand on the brink of the overfall,
as if to give a chance to any unlucky traveller
who may approach too near the danger; fully
three-quarters of a mile away on the far side
stands the gloomy forest of black pines, relieved
by a glimpse of the open side-hills of the Caribou
Mountains. Another small portage was
necessary a mile or two above; but from the spot
where we camped that night we never had to
lift canoe or skiff out of the water till we reached
the foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>The next day we passed a couple of Cree
lodges, and finding moose-meat plentiful made
the most of our opportunity, as a gale of wind
sprang up right ahead and prevented travel.</p>

<p>It was not till sundown on the eleventh day
from Chipeweyan that we completed our journey
of two hundred and eighty miles, and put
ashore at the Company's trading-post at Fort
Vermillion. Here the appearance of the country
suddenly changes; stretches of open prairie dotted
with small poplars take the place of the pine-woods,
and the sand-bars in the river begin to
give way to gravel, and the banks rise higher
and higher as one journeys up-stream. We
reached Vermillion late in September, in the full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
glory of the autumn; the sharp morning frosts
had coloured the poplar leaves with the brightest
golden tints, and the blue haze of an Indian summer
hung over prairie and wood. Away on the
Great Slave Lake a half-breed had told me of
the beauties of Vermillion as a farming country,
and had explained that all the good things of
the world grew there freely, so that I was prepared
for the sight of wheat and barley fields,
which had this year produced a more abundant
harvest than usual; potatoes and other vegetables
were growing luxuriously, cattle and horses were
fattening on the rich prairie grass, and it seemed
that there was little to be gained by leaving such
a fertile spot in the face of the winter that would
soon be upon us.</p>

<p>Vermillion is also an important fur-post, and
probably to-day the best in the North for beaver
and marten; but there are several free-traders
on the Peace River, and the Company have to
carry on their business with the extra difficulty
of competition, which always raises the price of
fur. It is all very well to say that no Company
should have the monopoly of trading over so
vast a territory, but after all the Indians are little
benefited by the appearance of the free-traders.
The Hudson's Bay Company have always
treated the Indians fairly and leniently, taking
the greatest care only to import articles absolutely
necessary to the welfare of the natives.
Guns, ammunition, blankets, capotes, dress-stuff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
for the women, and tea and tobacco, have always
been the principal contents of the store; and
these are sold at absurdly low prices, when the
cost of the long and risky transport is considered.
The Indians' love of gaudy colours was
always indulged, but the goods were of the best
material. Then came the free-trader with a
stock of bright cheap clothing, a variety of dazzling
tinsel, or perhaps a keg of molasses, which
attracted the eye and palate of the wily hunter,
so that he would give up his rich furs for the
worthless trash, only to find himself short of all
the necessaries for maintaining life in the woods
when the snow began to fall again. No amount
of experience enables him to resist the temptation;
but the long enduring Hudson's Bay Company
always listens to his tale of woe and helps
him out of his difficulties, accepting his promise,
ever readily given and as readily broken, to hand
in his fur in the following spring to the officer
in charge of the post. Whenever the often-told
story of a band of Indians caught by the horrors
of starvation reaches the fort, the Company
sends to the rescue, and every winter saves many
a man from death, while the free-trader, having
taken as much fur as he can out of the country
during a short summer's trip, is living at ease
on the confines of civilization. The days are
long gone by when a prime silver fox could be
bought for a cotton pocket-handkerchief, but still
the rumours brought from this little known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Northern country attract the venturesome trader,
usually to his own loss, and always to the upsetting
of the Company's wise system of dealing
with the Indians.</p>

<p>Vermillion has a comparatively large population,
outside the numerous <i>employés</i> of the country.
Both the Protestant and Roman Catholic
churches have missions here, and several half-breeds
have taken up an irregular method of
stock-raising and small farming to help out the
uncertain living afforded by fur-trapping. Mr.
Lawrence, a practical hard-working farmer from
Eastern Canada, has been successful with a farm
three miles above the fort; but for many years
to come there is not the slightest reason for that
emigration of farmers to Peace River which wild
enthusiasts clamour for. So much talk about
this scheme has lately appeared in the Canadian
newspapers, mostly, no doubt, as one of the political
cries which find such favour with the
statesmen of Ottawa, that I cannot allow this
opportunity to pass without a word of warning
to any intending settler. I made careful inquiries
and observations along the whole length of Peace
River, and I do not for a moment deny that in
some parts of its course crops of wheat and barley
may be raised in favourable seasons, as the
well-managed farms of Mr. Lawrence, at Vermillion,
and Mr. Brick, higher up at Smoky
River, fully attest; but these farms, and all the
spots in which grain ripens, are in close proximity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to the bed of the river, and here the amount
of arable land is limited. Climb the steep banks
and take a glance over the millions of fertile
acres which the philanthropic politician wishes to
see cultivated; notice the frost on a summer's
morning, and make the attempt, as has often
been made already, to raise a crop on this elevated
plateau. In ten years' time this may be
a cattle-country, although the hay-swamps are insufficient
to ensure enough feed for the long winter;
but let us have an end of this talk of sending
poor settlers to starve in a land unable to supply
food to the Indian, who is accustomed to a life
of continual struggle with a relentless nature.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson entertained me royally at the fort,
but here again was the same trouble that I had
found at Chipeweyan; no crew was procurable,
and there was a journey of three hundred and
fifty miles to Dunvegan before I had any chance
of getting men. José and Dummy, who had both
worked right well up to now, considered they
were far enough away from their beloved Fort
Smith; and José had an extra attraction in Dummy's
sister, who was waiting his return to make
him happy for ever, but was not very reliable in
case of a more prepossessing admirer coming to
the fore. José made a touching speech at parting:
"God made the mountains, the lakes, and
the big rivers," he said. "What is better than
drifting down Peace River singing hymns? You
are going up-stream to cross the big mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
back to your own country; I am going down-stream
to marry Dummy's sister; I shall think of
you many times." Dummy smiled and nodded
affectionately, and the pair shot out into the
river with my canoe, leaving me on the bank
with only Murdo for my crew and no means
of conveyance.</p>

<p>Now if I could have got a small dug-out
wooden canoe, and pottered away up-stream with
Murdo, tracking in turns, we should have got
on very well; but unfortunately there was nothing
but a large and somewhat clumsy skiff available,
and this we finally had to take. The evening
before we were to start I received a visit
from a man whom I shall allude to as John.
Long before in merry England he had seen better
times, and was evidently intended by nature
for a sedentary life, or any other kind of life
than the physical activity necessary to accomplish
quickly and successfully a boating-trip up a swift-running
river; in reality he was powerful enough,
and but for his extraordinary laziness might have
earned a good living anywhere. John told me
he wished to leave Peace River and cross the
mountains to Quesnelle, and would be glad to
render me every assistance in his power if I
would let him take advantage of this chance
to get out of the country. In spite of the warnings
of Mr. Wilson and everybody else who knew
John's character, I went on the theory that when
one is shorthanded any kind of a man is better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
than no man, but was speedily disabused of this
idea after leaving the fort. He turned sulky
when he found that I would stand no shirking,
and was painfully slow on the tracking-line, awkward
in letting go or tying a knot, and, although
he had been five years at boating, absolutely without
knowledge of the duties of bowsman or
steersman. In addition to this he was just as
useless in camp, and conceived a violent hatred
to Murdo, who fully reciprocated the feeling.
Once, on being heartily cursed while he was
tracking, John threatened to desert and go back
to Vermillion, but when we ran the skiff ashore
and offered to help him build a raft and to give
him a week's rations, he hastily withdrew his
proposition. I hoped to be able to leave him at
some fort <i>en route</i>, but I found John was too
well known, and no one would accept the horrible
responsibility of keeping him for a winter on any
terms. A man like this takes all the pleasure
out of a journey when good temper is the almost
invariable rule, and everybody takes his
share of the tracking and wading, the paddling
and poling, as part of the ordinary day's work.</p>

<p>At this time of year, when the water is at its
lowest, tracking is a comparatively easy matter,
and taking half-hour spells at a sharp walk we
made good day's journeys, although we should
have done much better with a canoe. It was a
hard time for moccasins, but we could get them
at every fort we passed; sometimes we found an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Indian encampment on the bank, and a small
present of tea and tobacco to the women ensured
neat patches over the gaping holes in the moose-skin
soles.</p>

<p>The fourth day out from Vermillion we
reached the mouth of Battle River coming in
from the north, and found a small trading-post
with a French half-breed in charge. He told
us that the Indians had been killing a great many
moose, and that he had already bought the dried
meat of sixteen as a start towards his winter
stock of provisions; black bear too were numerous
on Battle River, and there were reports of
grizzly having been seen. This would probably
be one of the best points from which to enter
the unknown country between Peace River and
the Great Slave Lake.</p>

<p>I never remember to have seen in any part of
Canada such a fine autumn as we enjoyed between
Vermillion and the Rockies; there was
hardly a day's rain the whole time, and, although
a sharp white frost usually made a cold camp,
the days were bright and at times almost too hot
for tracking. Often we saw the fresh tracks
of moose and bear, but never happened to see
an animal of any kind, and as we could afford no
time for hunting did not fire a single shot at
big game; geese and ducks we could have killed
every day if there had been any necessity for
doing so.</p>

</div>

<p>Fifteen days of continuous travel from Vermillion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
took us to the junction of Smoky River,
the principal tributary of the Peace, flowing towards
the south-west not far from some of the
head-waters of the Athabasca. This junction is
rather an important point, as it is close to the
end of the waggon-road to the Lesser Slave Lake,
lying seventy-five miles to the south. Here the
trading-goods brought overland are loaded on to
scows and boats, to be sent down-stream to Vermillion
and up-stream to Dunvegan, St. John's,
and Hudson's Hope. A little above are Mr.
Brick's mission and the farm that I have already
spoken of, besides a settlement of half-breeds,
more hunters than farmers, well known as the
laziest and most worthless gang on the whole
length of Peace River. Many efforts have been
made to get these people to pay more attention
to their potato-patches as the game is getting
killed out, but all in vain; sometimes they will
fence in a piece of ground and plant seed, but
will take no further trouble with the crop, and
generally use their fence-rails for firewood during
the next winter. Luckily whitefish are very
plentiful in the Lesser Slave Lake within two
days' journey, or starvation would certainly play
havoc at Smoky River.</p>

<p>I enjoyed a long talk with Mr. Brick in his
pleasant home in the wilds, where we spent a
night; he kindly furnished me with supplies that
I was short of, and three days afterwards we
arrived at Dunvegan, another celebrated fur-post,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
situated on the north bank of the river at
the foot of a high bluff known as the Cap. Here
again was abundant evidence of the fertility of
the soil in the crops harvested by the Company
and the missionaries. Across the river, twenty
miles away, is the Company's cattle-<i>ranche</i>,
where the oxen used on the waggon-road are
raised and a fair amount of beef is annually
killed. Some thoroughbred stock has been imported
and should prove successful, but of course
there is no paying market for a large amount of
cattle, although there are plenty of hungry people
who would be glad of a chance to eat beef.</p>

<p>At Dunvegan, besides Mr. Round who was in
charge of the fort, I met Mr. Ewen Macdonald,
the chief of Peace River District, with headquarters
at Lesser Slave Lake. He had just finished
his inspection of the upper river-posts, and
had left Hudson's Hope, the last establishment
east of the mountains, a few days previously; he
reported that the snow was already low down on
the foot-hills, and advised me strongly to give
up my attempt to cross the Rockies so late in
the autumn. He told me, however, that a free-trader
was expected in from the west side of
the mountains, and if I was lucky enough to meet
him I should probably be able to secure the
service of some of his crew who would be returning
to Quesnelle.</p>

<p>Above Dunvegan the valley of the river contracts,
the banks rise for several hundred feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
in height, and the strength of the current increases.
The hundred and twenty miles to St.
John's took us seven days and a half to travel,
and in many places we had to keep two men on
the line to stem the strong water; the tracking
too was bad, as the banks had fallen in several
spots, and John, who had been up and down the
river three times before, proved a very poor pilot.
The weather was colder, and a sheet of ice
formed over the back waters and close to the
bank out of the current.</p>

<p>At St. John's we found Mr. Gunn busy with
a band of Indians who were taking their winter
supplies, and I had a chance of hearing their
accounts of the wilderness to the north in the
direction of the Liard River; they described it as
a muskeg country abounding in game and fur,
but a hard district to reach, as the streams are
too rapid for canoes and the swamps too soft for
horses to cross. They occasionally fall in with
a small band of buffalo, but have never seen them
in large numbers. Sometimes by ascending
Half-way River, a stream adjoining Peace River
twenty-five miles above St. John's, they meet the
Indians from Fort Nelson on the south branch
of the Liard.</p>

<p>We had now passed out of the Cree-speaking
belt and the language became that of the Beaver
Indians, a far inferior language to Cree, resembling
in sound and in many of the words
some of the dialects of the Chipeweyan tongue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Mr. Gunn had learned to speak Beaver fluently,
and was now going up to Hudson's Hope to interpret;
he was a great help to us both as pilot
and on the line, and with two men always tracking
we took little notice of the strong stream
which we found throughout the fifty miles to
the next fort.</p>

<p>Snow was falling heavily when we left St.
John's, and it looked as if the winter had set
in, but next day the ground was bare again, and
a west wind from across the mountains blew
warm as a summer's breeze. We camped for a
night at the mouth of Half-way River, heading
towards the north through a wide open bay which
seems to invite exploration. A considerable
quantity of gold dust has been taken out of some
of the gravel-bars along this part of Peace River,
and Half-way River is supposed to be a paradise
for the miner and hunter, but I could not
hear of any white man having ever penetrated
far up this valley. On the afternoon of Sunday,
October 26th, on rounding a bend in the river,
we caught our first glimpse of the snowy peaks of
the Rocky Mountains that I had travelled so far
to reach; but the sublime is often mixed with the
ludicrous, and when John in his admiration of
the scenery slipped off a narrow ledge of shale
along which he was tracking and fell with an
oath into the river, the snowy peaks were forgotten
in the joy that always greets other people's
misfortunes in this sort of travelling.</p>

<p>A short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span> distance below Hudson's Hope we
passed a remarkable group of high basaltic
islands, differing entirely from anything in the
neighbourhood, and affording a strong contrast
to the low gravelly islands so numerous in the
course of this river. In the afternoon of the
27th we unloaded the skiff and hauled her up on
the beach in front of the fort, to lie there till
anybody might want to run her down-stream the
following spring.</p>

<p>Hudson's Hope is a small unpretentious establishment,
standing on the south side of Peace
River, a mile below the wild cañon by which this
great stream forces its way through the most
easterly range of the Rocky Mountains. The Indians
were all encamped in their moose-skin
lodges on the flat close to the fort waiting for
the trade to begin, and I was surprised to hear
how few representatives of the once numerous
tribe of Beavers are left. It is the same at St.
John's and Dunvegan, and the total Indian population
of the upper Peace River cannot exceed
three hundred, an immense falling off since Sir
Alexander Mackenzie first crossed the mountains
by this route. The biggest lodge was occupied
by Baptiste Testerwich, a half-breed Iroquois,
descended from the Iroquois crew left here many
years ago by Sir George Simpson, formerly Governor
of the Hudson's Bay Company. Baptiste
had a house at Moberley's Lake twelve miles to
the south, and is well known as the most successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and most enduring of moose-hunters. A remarkable
point about the man is his hardiness
and indifference to cold; in the dead of winter he
wears no socks in his moccasins, which to any
other man would mean a certainty of frozen feet,
and the Indians say that his feet are so hot that
the snow melts in his tracks in the coldest
weather.</p>

<p>Once again arose the trouble about guides to
take us to Macleod's Lake. John had been there
before, but I had already seen too much of his
piloting to trust myself in his hands, and was
quite sure that he would lose his way if there
was the least possibility of doing so. The free-trader
from across the mountains had not yet arrived,
and as it was getting late in the year
there was a chance of his being frozen in before
he reached Hudson's Hope. Besides the Peace
River route there is the Pine River Pass, farther
to the southward, heading almost directly to
Macleod's Lake. A party of surveyors once came
through this pass several years ago, and the Indians
use it habitually in the summer; but none
of the Beavers would volunteer to guide us
through at this time of the year, as a heavy
snowfall might be expected immediately.</p>

<p>I decided to wait a few days for the trader, and
we had a very festive time at Hudson's Hope; a
ball was given every night, and the moose-dance,
rabbit-dance, and duck-dance were kept up till
the small hours. A ball is not an expensive entertainment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
at an out-of-the-way trading-post;
no invitations are necessary, but a scrape of the
fiddle at the door of the master's house fills the
ball-room in a few minutes. If the master is in
a liberal state of mind, a cup of tea is provided
for his guests, but in any case the river is close,
and if anyone is thirsty there is plenty of water.
On the third night the ceremonies were interrupted
by the sound of a gunshot on the opposite
bank, and an Indian came across with the news
that the trader had arrived at the west end of
the cañon with two small scows, and that some
of his crew were going back to Quesnelle.</p>

<p>Baptiste lent me a horse on the following day,
and I rode over to interview the new arrivals. A
fair trail, twelve miles in length on the north
side of the river, leads to the navigable water
above the cañon, while the stream runs a circuitous
course of probably thirty miles. I could
get little information as to the nature of this
cañon; even the Indians seem to avoid it, and,
though accounts of it have been written, nobody
appears to have thoroughly explored this exceptionally
rough piece of country. I went down a
few miles from the west end, but found the bluffs
so steep that I could seldom get a view of the
water, and could form no idea of the character
of the rapids and waterfalls. There is some quiet
place in the middle of the cañon where the Indians
cross on the ice, but beyond this they could
tell me little about it.</p>

<p>Right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span> in the centre of the gap by which the
trail crosses stands the Bull's Head, a solitary
mountain well known to travellers coming from
the west, as it can be seen many miles away, and
in full view to the south is a huge flat-topped
mountain, covered with perpetual snow and fit
to rank with any of the giants of the main range.
The trail reaches a considerable elevation above
the river level, and from the summit the upper
waters of the Peace are seen winding away to
the west, through a broad valley flanked by hills
of ever increasing height, as far as the eye can
reach. Close to the river the slopes are open or
thinly timbered with pine and poplar, but the big
mountains are clothed nearly to their summits
with the dense, almost impassable, forest growth
which is such a common feature in the scenery
as the Pacific Coast is approached.</p>

<p>At the far end of the portage, on the bank
of the river, stand a rough shanty and trading-store.
Here I made the acquaintance of Twelvefoot
Davis, who acquired this name, not from
any peculiarity of stature, but from a small
though valuable mining claim of which he had
been the lucky possessor in the early days of
British Columbia. A typical man of his class is
Davis, and his story is that of many a man who
has spent his life just in advance of civilization.
Born in the Eastern States of America, a 'Forty-niner
in California, and a pioneer of the Caribou
Diggings discovered far up the Fraser River in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
'Sixty-one, he had eventually taken to fur-trading,
which has ever such an attraction for the
wandering spirit of the miner. Here among the
mountains and rivers where formerly he sought
the yellow dust he carries on his roaming life.
There is a strong kinship between the two enterprises;
the same uncertainty exists, and in each
case the mythical stake is always just ahead.
No failure ever damps the ardour of miner or
fur-trader, or puts a stop to his pleasant dreams
of monster nuggets and silver foxes.</p>

<p>Davis was making all possible haste in packing
his cargo across the portage with horses; an
Indian and a half-breed were going back to
Quesnelle, and would gladly enter my service as
guides. A small stock of goods was to be left
at the west end of the portage, and Thomas Barrow,
the only white man who had come down
with Davis, was to remain in charge of the trading-post
during the winter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p>On November 5th I camped at the head of
the cañon with my crew, Murdo, John, Charlie,
a half-breed from Quesnelle, and Pat, a full-blooded
Siccanee from Fraser Lake ready to
make a start up-stream the following morning
with a long narrow canoe dug out of a cotton-wood
log. But in the night the weather changed;
snow fell heavily, a severe frost set in, and ice
was forming rapidly along the banks. Baptiste,
the Iroquois, who had come across the portage
to see us off, had brought me a dozen pair of the
best moose-skin moccasins from his daughters,
who were beyond compare the <i>belles</i> of Hudson's
Hope. Baptiste had spent many years of his life
in this part of the country, and I was quite ready
to listen to his opinion on the chances of getting
through to Macleod's Lake. He would not hear
of our starting with a canoe under the changed
conditions of weather: it was the winter; the ice
would catch us in less than three days, and we
should be lucky if we could get back on foot
through the deep snow. His advice was to wait
a fortnight till the river set fast, and occupy ourselves
in making hand-sleighs, while he would
make us five pairs of snow-shoes, and then we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
might walk the two hundred miles to Macleod's
Lake in comfort. Accordingly I gave orders for
the lodge, which we still had with us, to be pitched
in a clump of poplars a short distance above
Barrow's house, and we busied ourselves with
cutting birch and bending sleighs in readiness
for our trip.</p>

<p>The cold snap continued for several days, but
very little ice was running, although the eddies
and backwaters were frozen up; then the weather
grew milder again, and I could see that we had
missed our chance. It was past the middle of
November, and the river, by all accounts, is
usually frozen solid at this time of year; it seemed
too risky to start out so late to try and make a
passage with open water. Meantime we were
taking things easily when, as it turned out, we
should have been travelling; there was not much
to shoot beyond wood-grouse and rabbits, but
with these we could keep the pot going, and time
went pleasantly enough in short expeditions into
the surrounding hills.</p>

<p>And now a warm Chinook wind came sweeping
across from the Pacific, and licked up the
snow from the ground, while the ice broke away
from the banks and drifted down in little floes
to be ground to pieces in the cañon. I could bear
the inactivity no longer, and, with a recklessness
that I had plenty of opportunity to repent later
on, gave orders on November 25th for the canoe
to be got ready on the morrow to start up-stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and take the chances of being caught by the ice
in the main range of the Rocky Mountains. I
consulted Charlie and Pat about the route, and
they both said they could make no mistake in
finding the way to the Hudson's Bay Fort on
Macleod's Lake, as they had just come down the
river, and Charlie had made the journey the year
before; if we could succeed in getting to the
junction of the Findlay and Parsnip, just beyond
the big mountains, before the ice caught us, there
could be no difficulty in reaching the fort on foot
in about four days' travel.</p>

<p>At the risk of being verbose and boring any
reader who has struggled thus far through the
record of my wanderings in the North, I must
now enter somewhat fully into the details of
travel, and describe minutely the events that
happened during the next month, in order to answer
once for all the numerous questions that
I have been asked as to what took place on that
terrible winter journey in the Rocky Mountains.
When I reached civilization again, and found
that part of the story had leaked out, I received
plenty of gratuitous advice as to what I should
have done and where I should have gone, from
people who had never themselves been in a like
predicament, and had no further knowledge of
hardship than perhaps having had to pay a long
price for a second-rate dinner. I discovered that
the easiest method of satisfying them was to let
them tell the tale of my adventures in their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
way, and assent readily to their convincing proofs
that if they had been there all would have gone
well. I admit freely that it was a stupid act to
leave a supply-post so late in the year, unprovided
as we were with the necessary outfit for
winter travelling; but think I was justified in
trusting to the local knowledge of my native
guides to bring our party in safety to Macleod's
Lake after we were forced to abandon the canoe.</p>

<p>Walter Macdonald, a son of Mr. Ewen Macdonald
of Lesser Slave Lake, and Tom Barrow
both gave me every assistance in their power to
provision my crew for what is usually an eight
or nine days' journey. Meat was not to be had,
and there was little chance of finding big game
along the course of the river, but a hundred
pounds of flour, a few pounds of beans and rice,
and a small sack of potatoes, besides plenty of
tea and tobacco, would surely last us this short
journey, and, even if we found it impossible to
travel quickly, a few days of short rations could
easily be endured.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon of Wednesday, November
26th, when I started the canoe off, and
the sun was down before I had settled up accounts
and said good-bye to the friends whom
I did not expect to meet again for many a long
day. The moon was full, and I had no difficulty
in finding my way six miles through the woods
to an old miner's cabin at which we had arranged
to camp for the night. At the first streak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
dawn we were off again, travelling our best with
two and sometimes three men on the line; the
current was strong, but the tracking on the gravel-bars
perfect. That night there was a heavy snowstorm,
while the ground froze hard and caused
many a nasty fall on the slippery stones during
the next two days. On Saturday morning cakes
of soft ice began to run, but we found that most
of them were brought down by a large tributary
coming from the north, and above its mouth the
river was comparatively clear of ice. The same
afternoon we reached the entrance to the main
range of mountains, and under the first peak of
the chain tracked up a strong rush of water
with a heavy sea at its foot, commonly known as
the Polpar Rapid, a curious corruption of <i>la
Rapide qui ne parle pas</i>, so named by the old
<i>voyageurs</i> from the absence of the roar of
waters which usually gives ample warning of the
proximity of a rapid. Part of the cargo we
portaged to keep it dry, and above the strong
water lay a quiet stretch of river, winding away
in the gloomy black chasm between the huge
mountains, which in many places takes the form
of a sheer bluff hanging over the stream.</p>

<p>We camped just above the Polpar, and another
night's snow made the tracking worse than ever;
often it was necessary to put the line aboard and
take to the paddles, to struggle round some steep
point upon which a coating of frozen snow made
it impossible to stand. Ice was running in large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
pans and steering was difficult, but we got on
fairly well, and were far in the heart of the
mountains when we camped on Sunday night
under one of the steepest and most forbidding
peaks that I ever remember to have seen in any
part of the Rockies.</p>

<p>Monday was really cold, and our difficulties
increased; the tow-line was sheeted with ice
and three times its ordinary weight, while the
channel was in many places almost blocked; poles
and paddles had to be handled with numbed fingers,
and our moccasins from constant wading
turned into heavy lumps of ice; but we pushed
on, and at nightfall had passed the mountains
and emerged into a more inviting country. It
was evident, however, that canoe-work was nearly
over for the year, but we determined to make
one more attempt, as the junction of the Findlay
and Parsnip was not far ahead, and there
was just a chance that the ice was coming from
the Findlay and we might find the Parsnip, up
which our course lay, clear enough for navigation.
On Tuesday we made the most dangerous
day's travel that I ever experienced in a canoe;
the river was far too full of ice to handle even
a "dug-out" with safety, and we had to make
many crossings in the swift current among the
running floes. I made it a point that everybody
should keep on the same side of the river to assure
our all being together in case of accident,
and we had several narrow escapes from being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
nipped. At dinner-time we came in sight of the
broken water of the Findlay Rapid, and found
the big eddy on the south side of the river completely
blocked with ice. We went through the
risky man&oelig;uvre of skirting the edge of the eddy
with the floes whirling round us in the strong
running water, and, finding a solid spot, hauled
the canoe over the ice to the shore, making a half-mile
portage to the foot of the rapid. A very
close shave of capsizing filled the canoe with
water; but the second attempt at tracking through
the swift current and blocks of ice was more
successful, and, as the short day was drawing
to its close, we were paddling under a high bluff
which prevented our using the tracking-line.
Here darkness caught us, and our position was
perilous in the extreme; the current was so strong
that our best pace was required to stem it at all,
and many times we had to drift back to avoid
collision with the ice that was grinding past us.
A couple of hours' hard work brought us to the
first spot at which we could effect a landing, but
it was no easy matter to carry the cargo up the
frozen bank; we secured the canoe as well as
we could, and found ourselves on a small flat
covered with willows and abundance of firewood.
Towards midnight the grinding of the ice became
less noticeable and before daylight ceased
entirely; the river above us had set fast and
further water-travel was impossible. When
morning broke we saw the Findlay branch completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
jambed with ice stretching away to the
north-west, and the Parsnip bending sharply to
the south presented a similar appearance.</p>

<p>A glance at our position is not out of place,
and a good map might have saved us from the
serious trouble we afterwards experienced.</p>

<p>Far away in the mountains of British Columbia,
in a country little known to the white man
and at no great distance from the Pacific Ocean,
the Findlay River has its source, while the Parsnip
rises close under the Rocky Mountains on
their west side, and, skirting the foot-hills, joins
the Findlay at the spot where we now encamped.
Below the junction the stream, already of considerable
size and known as the Peace River,
pours through the black rent in the backbone of
the North American continent many thousands
of feet below the summits of the mountains, and
takes its course towards the Arctic Ocean at the
mouth of the great Mackenzie. The most extraordinary
feature in this reversion of the laws of
Nature is the extreme tranquillity of the stream
in passing through the main range, for with the
exception of the Findlay and Polpar Rapid, one
at either end of the pass, there is no difficulty in
navigating a canoe. In passing the eastern range
above Hudson's Hope the cañon is rough to the
last degree, and one would expect to find the
same thing among the higher mountains. A third
branch, the Omineca, once a celebrated mining-camp,
joins the Findlay, but is a much smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
stream. To reach Fort Macleod we had to follow
the Parsnip and turn up a tributary branch
known as Macleod's River, draining Macleod's
Lake into the Parsnip.</p>

<p>I had another long conversation with Charlie
and Pat as to the best plan of action, and pointed
out to them that if there was the least doubt
about finding the lake we might still get back to
Hudson's Hope, as by the aid of a few portages
over ice-jambs one can travel down-stream in
company with the floes long after it has become
impossible to force a passage against them, and
when we reached the east end of the pass it would
be easy to walk through the level country. But
both the guides laughed at the idea of their getting
lost, and again reminded me of the fact that
only a few weeks before they had come from
Macleod. If we could cross the Parsnip, they
said, we had only to follow the west bank till we
came to the Little River, and then half a day
would take us to the fort; in four days from now,
or five at the latest, we should reach the end of
our journey. The morning of December 4th
was spent in making a scaffold on which to store
my rather bulky cargo, which of course had to
be left with the intention of returning from Fort
Macleod with a dog-sleigh. After dinner we
started on foot, every man carrying his blanket
and a small load of provisions, kettles, and necessaries
of various kinds. I decided to take no
gun, as I only had a dozen shot-cartridges left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and a gun is always an impediment in walking
through the woods, although there is a good old
saying in the North that men should not part
with their guns till the women throw away their
babies.</p>

<p>One thing that I thought might cause some
trouble was the fact of our having no snow-shoes,
and the snow would soon be deep enough
to require them. We took all our beans and rice,
but left about thirty pounds of flour in a sack
on the scaffold, thinking it needlessly heavy to
carry, and that it was better to run short for a
day or two than overload ourselves and prevent
rapid travelling.</p>

<p>The ice was piled up high on the banks, and
we began badly by climbing over a steep hill
covered with such heavy timber that the pace
was slow, and it was night when we came out
on the bank of the Parsnip not more than four
miles from our last camp. The next day we
did rather better, but, getting among burnt
timber and deep snow, had many heavy falls.
In the evening we found a jamb in the river, and,
making rather a risky crossing with the chance
of our ice-bridge breaking up at any moment,
camped on the Macleod side, thinking that we
were now surely safe enough, and the worst
thing that could happen might be a little starvation
before we reached the fort. Then came
two days of fair travelling, sometimes on the
ice and sometimes in the woods, but the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
were so thick that it was hard to get through
them at all.</p>

<p>I have never seen a river freeze in the remarkable
manner that the Parsnip set fast this
summer. The first jamb had probably taken
place at the junction of the Findlay; the water
had backed up till it stood at a higher level than
the summer floods, and the gravel beach was
deeply submerged. There was no appearance
of shore-ice, as the constant rise and fall in the
water prevented a gradual freezing; jambs would
form and break up again, and huge blocks of ice
were forced on each other in every conceivable
position. Often too the ice was flooded, and it
was already cold enough to freeze wet feet; the
backwaters were full, and the ice on them usually
under water or hanging from the banks without
support; the shores were fringed with a tangled
mass of willows, heavily laden with snow and
their roots often standing in water, while behind,
rising to the summit of rough broken hills,
was the dense pine-growth of the great sub-Arctic
forest.</p>

<p>John caused a good deal of delay by not keeping
up, and I did not like to leave him far behind,
as he was clumsy on the ice, and there were
many treacherous spots where black running
water showed in strong contrast to the snow, and
the gurgle of a swift current suggested an unpleasant
ending to the unlucky man who should
break through. Everybody carried an axe or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
stick to sound the ice, and, excepting near the
banks where the water had fallen away from the
ice, there were no mishaps. Further delay was
caused by our frequently having to light a fire
to dry moccasins and keep our feet from freezing.</p>

<p>On the fourth night after abandoning the
canoe we camped close to a coffin hung between
two trees, as is the fashion of the Siccanees in
dealing with their dead; the guide recognised this
coffin, and told me we should certainly be at the
fort in two days. Beans and rice were finished,
but we had flour enough left for another day,
and this we baked into bread to save trouble in
cooking later on, and on the following day made
a fair journey considering the bad state of the
ice.</p>

<p>The next morning, after eating our last bite
of bread, we were going to try for the fort, and
to lighten our load left behind the kettles, for
which we had no more use, while some of us
were rash enough to leave our blankets; we expected
to be back with the dog-sleigh in a few
days, and could then pick up everything.</p>

<p>The water had risen again in the night and
the ice was useless for travelling on, so on the
guide's advice we left the river on the west bank,
and climbing the rough hills walked along the
ridge in a south-westerly direction, expecting
every hour to fall upon the little river running
out of Macleod's Lake. When night caught us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
we were still in the woods, and, although there
was no supper and snow was falling softly, a
bright fire and the prospect of reaching the fort
in the morning kept us in good spirits enough.
I was one of the unfortunates without a blanket,
and was glad to see daylight come again and with
it a cessation of the snowstorm. During the last
few days rabbit-tracks had been frequently seen
in the snow and grouse were plentiful, but we
had no means of securing game of any kind.</p>

<p>To make as sure as possible of getting food
the next day, I sent Murdo and Charlie ahead
without loads to make the best of their way to
the fort, while Pat and myself would stay by
John, who was already in difficulties, and carry
the packs.</p>

<p>Starting without breakfast is the worst part
of these starving times. The walking for the
first two hours was very hard, through a thick
growth of young pines rising among the blackened
stumps and fallen logs of a burnt forest, up
and down steep gullies, with the snow from the
branches pouring down our necks, and our loads
often bringing us up with a sudden jerk as they
stuck between two little trees. John soon gave
up his pack, and left it hanging on a bough,
where it remains probably till the present day.
About mid-day we came to the end of the ridge
and looked up the wide valley of the Parsnip.
Far below us we could trace its windings, and
branching away to the mountains in the west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
was a stream that Pat instantly declared to be
Macleod's River. Towards sundown we lit a
fire on a high bank above the stream, and John
in a fatuous manner remarked that he recognised
the place where he had camped with a boat's
crew some years before. We followed the fresh
tracks of our advanced party, and turning our
backs on the Parsnip walked on good shore-ice
till darkness compelled us to camp. I was rather
surprised to find that the river was not frozen
up and had much more current than I had expected,
but, as both John and Pat were quite
certain that all was right, I had not the least
doubt that we had at last reached Macleod's
River and should arrive at the fort in good time
the next day.</p>

<p>Another sleepless night gave me plenty of time
for reflection while John was comfortably rolled
up in a blanket that I had been carrying all day.
Four months had passed, and many a hundred
miles of lake and river travelled, since David had
seen the first star on that summer's night far
away in the Barren Ground; now I thought my
journey was nearly over, for two hundred miles
on snow-shoes from Fort Macleod to Quesnelle,
and three hundred miles of waggon-road from
Quesnelle to the Canadian Pacific Railway,
counted as nothing. It was true that we had
not tasted food for two days, and rations had
been short for some time past; but it was by no
means my first experience of starvation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
to-morrow evening at the latest we should be
in the midst of luxury once more. It was satisfactory
to think that we had succeeded in forcing
our way through the Rocky Mountains in the
face of the winter, and were every day approaching
a country made temperate by the breezes of
the Pacific; already the cedars, to be found only
on the west side of the main range, were showing
among the pines.</p>

<p>With the first grey light in the east I roused
my companions, and we started on shore-ice at
a good pace with the prospect of breakfast ahead.
Pat broke through shortly after leaving camp,
and, as he was afraid of freezing his feet, we lit
a fire to dry his moccasins, and the sun was up
when we set out again. A couple of hours later
we saw a thin blue column of smoke rising
straight up into the sky, and a nearer approach
showed that it came from the chimney of a cabin
hidden in the woods; a cheering sight at first,
but directly we reached the trail leading up from
the river I knew that something was wrong, and
something wrong at such a time meant something
very wrong indeed.</p>

<p>I had spent too much of my life among the
woods and mountains to be unable to read the
easy writing in the snow; two tracks leading up
the river late overnight, and the same two tracks
quite fresh coming down-stream and turning up
the trail. Murdo and Charlie must be in the
cabin, and could not have reached the fort; if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
they had been coming back with supplies they
would never have put ashore with starving men
so close up. Pushing open the rough door we
found them sitting one on each side of a small
fire of cedar-chips that were just crackling into
a blaze. "Have you been to the fort, Murdo?"
I asked, needlessly enough. "No." "Why not?
What is the matter?" "Charlie says it is the
wrong river; we are lost, like d&mdash;&mdash;d fools."</p>

<p>Murdo had described the situation concisely
enough, and I fully realised the awful position
we were in; lost and starving in the mountains
with no guns to procure food, no snow-shoes
with which to travel over the increasing depth
of snow, and no clothes to withstand the cold of
mid-winter which was already upon us.</p>

<p>There was still a hope, for Charlie was not
quite ready to admit that he was mistaken. Our
advance party had turned back on seeing a rapid,
and even now could not give me any accurate
description of this obstacle to navigation; if it
was so bad that a scow could not run down, it
was obvious that this could not be Macleod's
River, for I knew that no portage was necessary
to reach the lake. Pat was still sure that he had
recognised many places this morning, but could
not say anything about the log-cabin; it stood
back from the river, and there was a chance that
people, passing quickly down-stream, might have
missed seeing it when the foliage was thick on
the willows. The best plan seemed to first make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
sure about the rapid, so we started up-stream to
inspect it. I was very doubtful of any good
result coming from this move, when I saw that
the strength of the current increased, and the
mountains on each side of the stream grew higher
and steeper. Soon we passed a newly-built
beaver-house, which certainly was a strange object
on the side of a travelled river, and in a
couple of hours reached the rapid. Surely this
was enough to make anyone turn back; a heavy
shute of broken water down which no scow could
ever run without being smashed to pieces; even
Pat now acknowledged that he was hopelessly
lost. A valuable day had been wasted, and the
sun was down before we came again to the cabin,
where we decided on spending the night. Three
days we had been starving, and it was fully time
to take the first steps by which men in our desperate
position seek to maintain life as long as
possible. A thorough search in the shanty produced
nothing of value but an old lard-tin which
would serve as a kettle; there were many empty
boxes, labelled with enticing names and pictures
of canned fruit and of fat cattle that had been
converted into "Armour's Preserved Beef" at
Kansas City, Missouri; a large number of rotten
sacks, marked "Oregon Flour Patent Roller
Process," showed that someone had spent a winter
here, and an iron bottle containing a little
quicksilver proved that he had been a miner by
occupation. A board, with a notice in pencil that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
two men, whose names I forget, had arrived here
from Sandy Bar in a day and a half, conveyed no
meaning to us.</p>

<p>Among the necessary articles that we had been
carrying was a large piece of dressed moose-skin
for mending moccasins, and this seemed the most
edible thing we could find; five small strips, three
inches in length and an inch broad, were cut off
and put into the lard-tin to boil for supper. We
discovered Labrador tea growing in the woods,
and made a brew with the leaves as soon as we
thought the moose-skin was soft enough to eat.
Rabbit-snares were made by unravelling a piece
of string and set in the runs, but after trying
this plan on several nights not a rabbit was
caught, though we sometimes had the mortification
of finding a broken snare. After supper
of moose-skin and Labrador tea we felt in better
spirits, and with a good fire and a pipe of
tobacco discussed our position seriously enough.</p>

<p>Euclid, when he found himself incapable of
proving that any particular angle or line was the
exact size that he desired, had a habit of supposing
it to be of some other magnitude, and
by enlarging upon the absurdity of this supposition
so completely puzzled the aspiring student
that he was glad to admit any statement that the
inventor of the proposition suggested. This does
well enough on paper, but starving men have no
time to put this plan to the test of practice, and
when they find that a river is not the one they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
supposed it to be are at a loss to tell what stream
it really is.</p>

<p>Charlie, Pat, and John, who had all been to
Macleod's Lake before, told me frequently that
they had never heard of any river coming into
the Parsnip on the west side between the Findlay
and Macleod's River. Now, in a boating journey
the talk is always of points and rivers, and
the mouth of any tributary is always commented
upon, so it seemed unlikely that they should
have passed by this large stream without noticing
it; nor had they heard of any miner's cabin,
which must certainly have been spoken of in a
country where houses are scarce. There was a
possibility that we had come too far and missed
the mouth of Macleod's River, for we had sometimes
travelled on the east side of the Parsnip
to take advantage of better ice or a thinner
growth of timber, and I had heard David say
that the Little River was not easy for a stranger
to find. In any case it was better to retrace our
steps to the mouth of the stream that we had
been following, to see if our guides could recognise
any landmark, for the hills were conspicuous
and sometimes of remarkable shape.</p>

<p>At daylight on December 10th we left the
cabin and made tracks down-stream, taking with
us the lard-tin in which we had boiled more
moose-skin for breakfast. So far we had lost
no strength and, with the exception of John, who
was always behind, were going strong and well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
It was late in the afternoon when we reached
the river and once again stood on the bank of the
Parsnip. Across on the east side rose a high-cut
bank of yellow clay, a mark that any one
should recognise who had ever seen it before; but
Charlie and Pat both put on a hopeless blank
expression when I asked them if they knew the
place. No, they said, they had never seen it before
in their lives. Six weeks before they had
passed right under that cut bank in a scow, and
less than forty miles up-stream would have taken
us to the fort if we had only known it. These
men were a half-breed and an Indian, supposed
to be gifted with that extraordinary instinct of
finding their way in all circumstances which is
denied to the white man. John was just as much
to blame, although it was some years ago that
he travelled down the Parsnip; long afterwards,
when all the trouble was over, he confided to me,
as an excuse for his ignorance, that he had been
very drunk when he left Macleod and was unable
to make any accurate observations as to
courses and distances.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done but turn down
the Parsnip again and keep a bright look-out for
the mouth of the little river, in case we had
passed it. The ice was too much flooded to walk
on, and we camped high up on the mountain-side
in heavy falling snow. Another misfortune
befell us here; the bottom of the lard-tin was
burnt out during the process of melting snow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
and we had to give up the small comfort of
moose-skin and wild tea. Murdo and myself
spent a wretched night cowering over the fire
with the snow falling down our backs, for we
were still without blankets; daylight saw us
struggling through the thick growth of young
pines and an increased depth of snow, till at
noon, when everybody was thoroughly exhausted
and John had nearly given up all hope, we found
ourselves stopped on the side-hill by a series of
bluffs which no one felt equal to scaling. Fifteen
hundred feet below us lay the river, and as
a desperate alternative we descended the mountain,
with many bruises from stumbling over
logs hidden by the snow, to find that the water
had fallen in the night, and the ice, though rough
in the extreme, was dry enough to travel on.
After the night had closed down over the forest
we reached the place where the kettles and blankets
had been left, and things looked a little
brighter with the prospect of tea and a night's
sleep; but we knew now that Fort Macleod must
lie behind us, although there was little inducement
to make another attempt to reach it with
such untrustworthy guides. Our only chance
of life was to reach the entrance of the Peace
River Pass, where thirty pounds of flour lay on
a rough scaffold exposed to the mercy of the
wolverines!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p>Snow fell again in the night and increased our
difficulties. For a day and a half we forced our
way, sometimes on rough ice and sometimes
through the thick willow bushes, with frequent
rests as exhaustion overtook us, till we again
saw the Siccanee coffin hung in the trees. Here
we found the flour-sack that had been thrown
away on our up-stream journey, and scraped off
perhaps half a pound of flour which had stuck to
the sack when wet. At the same time a mouse was
caught in the snow, and, with no further preparation
than singeing off the hair, was cut into strips
and boiled with the flour into a thin soup. Every
man carried a tin cup in his belt, so a careful
distribution of the precious soup was made, and
the last pipe of tobacco smoked; we certainly derived
a little strength from this unexpected supply,
and our spirits improved greatly for a short
time.</p>

<p>The weather now turned colder and its increased
severity told on us heavily, for our
clothes were torn to rags by pushing through
the woods, and a starving man through loss of
flesh always feels the cold more severely than a
man in good condition. We often had to light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
a fire to prevent our feet from freezing when
wet from walking on flooded ice or breaking
through near the shore. The river was still open
in places and continually altering its level. John
was always far behind, and I expected to see
him drop at any time; but he had the advantage
of starting fatter than the rest of us, and took
good care of himself, always hanging in the rear
and coming into camp when the labour of throwing
out the snow and getting wood was accomplished.
Never once during the whole of this
march did he go ahead to break a trail through
the snow, which is of course the most fatiguing
work of all.</p>

<p>A little before sundown on December 17th, the
tenth day without eating anything but small
scraps of moose-skin and the soup at the coffin-camp,
we staggered among huge blocks of ice,
passed the junction of the Findlay, and soon
afterwards arrived at the <i>cache</i>. It was an
anxious moment as I crawled up the frozen bank
and waded through the snow to the scaffold; no
wolverine tracks were to be seen, and the flour
was lying untouched. Camp was made, a kettle
of thick paste boiled, and a cupful eaten every
half-hour to prevent any ill effects from straining
the weakened organs of the digestion.</p>

<p>But we were by no means out of our difficulties
yet. Thirty pounds of flour, without meat, is
the ordinary amount that would be given to five
men for two days, without taking into account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the fact that we had been starving for a long
time and were now reduced to skeletons. Before
us was the main range of the Rocky Mountains;
the snow would be drifted deep in the narrow
pass, and travel would be slow, if indeed we got
through at all. Another serious trouble was the
state of our moccasins; as they wore out we had
eaten them, and were now wearing rough apologies
for shoes which we had made out of the
moose-skin that was quickly getting very small
under the constant demands made upon it for
various purposes.</p>

<p>In the morning I measured the flour very carefully
with a cup into different loads, so that I
might be able to keep account of the quantity that
was used, and, taking a gun and what few cartridges
were left, we started for Tom Barrow's
cabin, which we hoped to be able to reach in three
or four days if the ice should prove good. In
this we were terribly disappointed, for at the
end of the second day, after wading through
deep snow, and frequently putting ashore to light
a fire on account of the intense cold, we camped
but a short distance below the Findlay Rapid.
John's feet were frozen already, and all of us
were touched in the face; there was always great
difficulty in lighting a match with numbed fingers,
but birch-bark was plentiful, and being readily inflammable
was nearly sure to blaze up at once.
Our only remaining axe was almost useless from
having been carelessly left for a night in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
fire. Much of the snow had drifted off the ice
and was lying three and four feet deep on the
banks, increasing the labour of making camp and
picking up firewood, for we were too weak to
do any effectual chopping even if our axe had
been in good condition. Without snow-shoes it
was impossible to walk through the forest in the
hope of finding grouse; and, after one or two
efforts, the exertion of wading waist-deep
through snow that reached to the belt was found
too great, and the attempt was abandoned.</p>

<p>On the third day a blizzard swept through the
pass, completely obscuring the opposite bank of
the river, which was here quite narrow. We attempted
to travel against it, but found our faces
were frozen before going a quarter of a mile.
Murdo and myself had always to light the
matches, as the other men suffered more from the
cold than we did; I knew that my hands were
already useless, and that if we continued to force
our way against the storm there would be little
chance of starting a fire further on. I gave orders
to turn back for the camp, and we spent the
short day in keeping up the fire that was still
burning. Besides the drift, a gust of wind would
often send down the masses of snow that had
gathered on the branches, putting out our little
blaze and filling up the hole that we had dug in
the snow, while the boughs themselves often fell
dangerously close to the camp. The allowance of
flour was cut down to two cupfuls among five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
men, and this was eaten in the form of paste,
which we found more satisfying than bread. The
Labrador tea was buried deep under the snow,
and from this time no more was obtained.</p>

<p>The shortening of rations produced grumbling
in the camp, especially from John, who declared
that it was better to eat well while the little flour
lasted, to gain strength to take us to the trading-post.
Murdo was more sensible in this respect,
but was beginning to lose the full use of
his head, and, besides the strong aversion he had
always shown to John, now developed a passionate
hatred to Charlie and Pat, whom rightly
enough he held responsible for our position. This
ill-feeling among the various members of our
party was increased tenfold by an episode which
took place on the following day. The morning
was very cold but with less wind, and, although
our faces froze again, we pushed on for an hour
or two and then made a fire on the bank. Here
we left the Indian and half-breed drying their
moccasins, and continued travelling down stream
to make a camp for the mid-day halt, knowing
that the others could catch us up easily with the
advantage of our road through the snow; this
they did just as our fire was blazing up. I asked
Charlie for his flour, as so far we had not used
any from his load, but when he produced it there
was not more than a cupful left in the bag. I
had given him five pounds of flour to carry, and
at once knew that our guides, who had caused all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the trouble, had now been guilty of stealing food,
when our lives depended on the scanty store that
we had picked up at the <i>cache</i>. For this offence,
at such a time, there is but one punishment: a
man on the point of starving to death cares little
whether you cut off the dollar a day that he is
earning or not; a blow struck would have fired
the train of discontent that was ready to explode;&mdash;the
only course open to me, if the offenders
were to be punished at all, was to put an end to
them both with the shot-gun that I carried. For
a long time I debated this question while a few
spoonfuls of flour were boiled for dinner, and
finally decided to let matters take their course;
there were still seven or eight pounds of flour
left, and by further reduction of rations we might
keep ourselves alive for a few more days; the
weather might be warmer, the ice less rough, and
the snowfall lighter if we could reach the far
end of the pass, but at present things looked very
black indeed. Flesh and strength were failing
rapidly; this loss of provisions would tell heavily,
and travelling through the gloomy pass under
the high mountains was more laborious than
words can describe. It was no good refusing
to give the thieves their share of rations, as this
might induce them to strike a blow in the night,
and deal us the death that they themselves deserved;
but the question might still have to be
decided, in case of a man dropping, whether his
life should be sacrificed and the offenders allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
to go free. If affairs came to the point which
everything seemed to indicate, there could now
be no fair drawing of lots to see who should die
that the survivors might support themselves by
the last resource of all.</p>

<p>The weather continued cold, and frozen feet
caused many delays; there was no chance here
to treat a frost-bite by the tender methods of
thawing with snow and rubbing with oil that
are practised in civilization, but feet were thrust
into a blazing fire and allowed to blister as they
would. John and Charlie suffered greatly from
this cause, and their pain in walking was much
increased. These delays were serious, for although
the Peace River Pass lies as far to the
south as the 56th parallel of latitude the days
were at their shortest.</p>

<p>For three more days we continued wading
through the snowdrifts, and crawling over rough
ice, continually changing our leader, till on December
24th we were stopped by another blizzard,
and forced to lie in camp all day. Rations
were by this time cut down to a spoonful of
flour in the morning and a strip of moose-skin
at night for each man. Not more than a pound
of flour was left, and the storm, far too fierce
for such wretched skeletons to face, might continue
for several days. Our situation seemed
utterly hopeless as we crouched over the fire that
was with difficulty maintained, and apparently
the end had come. There was none of the kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
sympathy for companions in misfortune which
men who share a common danger should have: a
mutual distrust was prevalent; hatred and the
wolfish madness of hunger ruled the camp; and
to this day I cannot understand how it was that
the fatal spark was never struck, and no tragedy
of murder and cannibalism enacted on the banks
of that ice-bound river without witnesses save
the great silent mountains and the God who made
them.</p>

<p>Christmas Day brought rather better weather,
although snow was still falling quietly, and, finding
open water in the river with shore-ice on
which the snow was not so deep as usual, there
was a great improvement in our case. An accident,
however, occurred which nearly put an end
to two of the party. Charlie and Pat, who were
leading at the time, ventured too near the edge
of the open water and broke through, not only
to the knees or waist, as had so often happened,
but over their heads in deep water with a strong
current, and we had some trouble in pulling them
out. It was very important that we should make
a fire at once, as the temperature was many degrees
below zero, and the men drenched to the
skin began to freeze directly. The accident had
taken place under a long steep bluff, and from
where we stood no firewood was to be seen on
our side of the river within a couple of miles.
By the greatest good fortune, on turning a point
we found a huge tree that had fallen over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
cliff and lay on the beach smashed up into firewood,
as if it had been prepared specially for our
use. A blaze was soon started, and the two half-drowned
men left to dry themselves. The most
unfortunate part of the affair was the wetting
of the matches which they carried. I had divided
these precious articles among the men in
case of accidents of this kind, for without fire
we should have had no chance of saving our
lives; as it turned out we never ran short of
matches and never once missed making fire, although
there was often trouble in procuring
wood; we were far too weak to handle a big log,
but usually found a dead cotton-wood tree, from
which the bark is easily pulled and makes the
best of fires.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we passed the Polpar Rapid,
which was completely frozen up, and emerging
from the pass caught the first sight of the sun,
that had been hidden from us for many days by
the high mountains. The ice below the rapid continued
fairly good till nightfall, when we were
forced to camp, although the moon was full and
we tried to travel by her light. But although
it was easy enough to see close ahead, it was impossible
to pick out the line of the best ice, and
the labour of travelling was increased by having
to force our way through drifts and piled-up ice
that we might have avoided in daylight.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving camp on the following
morning a grouse was killed, and I think even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
this little nourishment helped us a great deal to
accomplish our task of reaching the trading-post;
this was the only grouse we had seen since we
left the <i>cache</i>, although on the up-stream journey
birds had been plentiful enough. The ice
was still rough at times, but in some places the
river was open and good shore-ice made the
walking easy; the weather was much warmer,
with bright sunshine, and there was no danger
of freezing our feet. At dark camp was made
within a day's travel of Barrow's house, if only
we had strength enough to reach it.</p>

<p>The long night passed away, and just before
daylight we were staggering among the blocks of
ice in a scattered line. There was always difficulty
in starting from the camp, for there was
a certain amount of comfort in lying in our
blankets, and nobody was anxious to try whether
he could still stand upright or not. Our inclination
during the worst time was to lie down
and make no further effort, but after walking
half an hour we usually found ourselves in better
spirits. Soon after coming out on the ice, I
looked back to see how John was travelling, and
noticed that he was down. Charlie, who had
been behind with him, came up and said that
John could travel no longer and intended to stay
where he was. I stopped all the men, but Charlie
tried to push by me and said that he would
not wait for anyone. For the first time I had
to use threats to ensure my orders being carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
out, and taking the gun from my shoulder let
Charlie plainly see that I meant to shoot him if
he did not obey. This quickly brought him to
his senses, and John came up very slowly. He
wanted someone to stay with him and trust to
the others sending back provisions, but I would
not listen to this proposal. I told him that it
was only want of courage that prevented him
making any further effort; he was as strong as
the rest of us, and, if he would try, could keep up
quite easily; if he would come on till we reached
the place where we had had dinner on the second
day out with the canoe, we would make him a
camp and leave all our blankets, so that he might
have a chance of keeping himself alive till relief
came. On rounding a point we saw open
water ahead, and John, although far behind,
went far better on the smooth ice, and eventually
came in not more than an hour after us.
At noon the Bull's Head was in sight, and we
could see the line of hills at the foot of which
Barrow's house lay. The pace was fast for men
in our condition, but we kept up a steady walk,
leaving our blankets when there seemed a certainty
of reaching the house that night. The
sun was down when we passed the old shanty in
which we had camped for a night on the way up,
and by moonlight we travelled on, following
close to the edge of the open water and taking
little precaution to test the strength of the ice.
Soon the roar of the cañon was heard, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
seven o'clock we crawled up the steep bank and
stood in front of the cabin. I pushed open the
door, and shall never forget the expression of
horror that came over the faces of the occupants
when they recognised us. We had become used
to the hungry eyes and wasted forms, as our
misery had come on us gradually, but to a man
who had seen us starting out thirty-two days
before in full health the change in our appearance
must have been terrible. There was no
doubt that we were very near the point of death.
For my own part I felt a dull aching in the
left side of my head; I was blind in the left
eye and deaf in the left ear; there was a sharp
pain on each side just below the ribs; but my
legs, though not well under control, were still
strong. We had all completely lost the use of
our voices, and suffered greatly from the cracking
of the skin on hands and feet, which always
results from starving in cold weather; to say
that we were thin conveys no idea of our miserable
condition. It is needless to go into the
details of our recovery; but under Barrow's
careful nursing, and restrictions as to the quantity
of food allowed, we all came back to health,
although for some days our lives were hanging
in the balance.</p>

<p>I can never sufficiently thank Tom Barrow
for his kind behaviour on this occasion. Of
course, everybody is sorry for starving people;
but it is rather a strain on this sympathy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
have to look after five men so near to death in
a small cabin among the Rocky Mountains, with
such slender supplies as had been left for a
winter's rations for two people. Without a murmur
he shared his blankets and his provisions,
although he knew that there was a good chance
of starving himself in the spring.</p>

<p>Barrow told us directly where we had made
our mistake. The river we had turned up was
Nation River, and the log-cabin had been occupied
some years before by a party of miners, but
very little gold had been taken out. Some distance
up Nation River was the old trail to the
Omineca mining-camp; but of course we should
not have known what trail it was if we had found
it. The mouth of the Nation River and the yellow
cut bank Barrow remembered perfectly, and
said there had been much talk about these landmarks
on the way down; it seems inexplicable
that three men, who had been over the route before,
should have made the mistake that so
nearly cost us our lives. If we had followed up
the Parsnip beyond the mouth of Nation River
we should have reached Macleod's Lake on December
12th at latest with only a few days'
starvation, and avoided all the misery that continued
till the 27th of that month.</p>

<p>In a week communication was opened with
Hudson's Hope, and Walter Macdonald did
everything he could to help us; but the same
thing had happened to him. A band of Beaver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Indians had been caught by starvation at the
mouth of the Pine River Pass, and had suffered
the same experiences as ourselves. Many had
been left by the way, but I think there were no
deaths, as provisions were sent out so soon as
the news reached Baptiste at Moberley's Lake.</p>

<p>At the end of a fortnight everybody was well
enough to travel; and to ease the strain on provisions
I sent Murdo, John, and Charlie to Lesser
Slave Lake, where they could get fish to support
them, and spare the resources of the upper
river posts. But even now these men could not
travel together, although they had full rations
and nothing to quarrel about. Murdo reached
the Lesser Slave Lake alone, John arriving several
days later, and I found Charlie at Dunvegan,
where he had already distinguished himself by
robbing from the priest's trading-store. A thorough
blackguard was Charlie, and it would have
been little loss to the world in general if he
had left his bones under the snow in the Peace
River Pass; he had begun his voyage badly by
stealing fifty dollars from his mother at Quesnelle,
and there were several other offences for
which the police had hunted him away from the
borders of civilization. Pat was to stay for the
winter with Barrow, and as soon as Baptiste
had made us snow-shoes we pottered about in
the woods together, hunting grouse and rabbits,
and had soon entirely recovered our
strength.</p>

<p>I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span> never heard any satisfactory explanation
of the gradual increase and sudden dying
out of the rabbits and lynx, which takes place
every seven years throughout the North. Starting
from the few survivors of the last epidemic,
the numbers increase slowly every season, till
in the sixth year the whole country is so over-run
with them that a man can travel anywhere
with no further provision than shot-gun and
snares. Then the disease breaks out, dead bodies
are found all through the woods, and scarcely
a living rabbit or lynx is to be seen. The autumn
of 1885 I spent on the head-waters of the Athabasca,
at the east end of the Tête Jaune Pass;
the rabbits were then at their height and as
plentiful as I ever saw them in England. 1892
will be the next big rabbit-year; but after
that famine is sure to be rife on Peace River,
as it is harder every year to kill moose, and for
the last two or three years the rabbit-snares have
kept many an Indian from starvation. This
rabbit-question is an important one to consider
before starting on an exploration trip in the
Peace River country, as in the good seasons there
is no danger of running short of provisions.</p>

<p>One day, as we were setting snares together,
Pat told me the story of the stolen flour. They
had stayed behind to dry their moccasins, and
Charlie had explained to Pat that I was keeping
the flour for the use of the white men, and that
their only chance of getting any was to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
themselves; Pat had objected at first, but afterwards
gave way when he saw Charlie cooking
the flour, and they had eaten about four pounds
between them. Judging from Charlie's character
I am inclined to believe the story, as Pat in all
other respects had behaved well under the pressure
of hardship, and had always done more than
his share of work in making camp and breaking
the trail.</p>

<p>While staying at Hudson's Hope, Macdonald
and I walked over to Moberley's Lake, twelve
miles to the south, to pay old Baptiste a visit.
The house stands within view of the big peaks
of the Rockies close to the edge of the lake, but
the appearance of the country is rather spoilt by
the abundant traces of forest fires that have
taken place of late years. The lake is a beautiful
sheet of water, ten miles in length, drained
by the Pine River, which falls into the Peace a
short distance above Fort St. John. Baptiste
has a fruitful potato-patch, and his women were
catching plenty of rabbits; there was moose-pemmican,
too, and dried meat, for the Fall hunt
had been successful. The Iroquois gave me a
pair of snow-shoes ornamented with tassels of
coloured wool, as well as a pair of beaded moccasins
which he made me promise not to eat,
and came with us to the fort to see us off.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p>It was towards the end of January, 1891, that
I left Hudson's Hope for Edmonton, a distance
of six hundred miles, giving up all further attempt
to reach Macleod's Lake. A son of Mr.
Brick, of Smoky River, turned up just before
I started, and promised to go with Pat to my
<i>cache</i> at the junction of the Findlay and Parsnip
when the days grew long in spring. The rough
ice would then be covered with deep snow, and
with snow-shoes and hand-sleighs it would be
easy to bring away the guns, journals, and many
other articles that I had been obliged to abandon.</p>

<p>Two days and a half took me to St. John's,
and after a week's stay there a dog-train, carrying
the winter packet, arrived, and I took this
chance of getting to Dunvegan. Alick Kennedy,
one of the very best half-breed <i>voyageurs</i> in Canada,
was in charge of the packet. The distances
this man has been known to run in a day would
hardly be credited in a land where people travel
by railways and steamboats: moreover, he is a
pleasant companion to travel with; his conversation
is interesting, and entirely free from the
boasting which most of the half-breeds indulge
in. Alick was captain of a boat-brigade on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Nile; and if all the Canadian contingent had
been of his stamp instead of the Winnipeg loafers,
who were too worthless to get employment
in their own country, a different story might
have been told of the behaviour of the <i>voyageurs</i>
on the march to Khartoum.</p>

<p>Five days took us to Dunvegan, where I again
met Mr. Macdonald, and travelled with him to
the Lesser Slave Lake. From Dunvegan we
made the portage straight to Smoky River, crossing
a pretty prairie country and camping a night
at Old Wives' Lake, where Mr. Brick winters
some of his cattle. With a splendid track along
the waggon-road, we made the ninety miles to
the Lesser Slave Lake in two days, and, judging
from the number of people and houses, we
seemed to have reached civilization already. Besides
the Hudson's Bay establishment, the missions
and the buildings of the free-traders, many
half-breeds have houses scattered along the lake,
and devote part of their attention to raising
horses and cattle, though of course whitefish are
the main support of life. A favourite haunt for
wildfowl is this lake in spring and autumn, but
big game and fur have been nearly killed out by
the large population, and most of the Indian
trade is done at the out-posts nearer to the hunting-grounds.</p>

<p>I spent several days at the fort, being well
treated as usual, and February was nearly finished
when I started with Mr. Frank Hardistay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
on my last journey with dogs. The Lesser Slave
Lake is about seventy miles in length, and covering
this distance easily in two days we travelled
down the Little Slave River which leaves the
east end of the lake. A good deal of labour
has been expended in blasting rocks out of the
channel of this river, to enable the steamer from
the Athabasca landing to reach the lake, and so
avoid the expense of building boats and engaging
crews to transport the Peace River cargo,
but so far these efforts have proved unsuccessful.</p>

<p>I think we followed the course of this stream
about twenty miles, then dived into the thick
pine-forest on the east bank, and making a
twelve-mile portage came out on the Athabasca
River, seventy miles above the landing at the
end of the waggon-road from Edmonton. The
Athabasca has here the same monotonous look
that one becomes so tired of in its lower reaches.
When a point was rounded another point exactly
similar showed three or four miles ahead,
and this continued till we reached the landing,
in clear cold weather, on March 3rd; three days
later our dogs, bearing the smartest of dog-cloths
and with sleigh-bells ringing merrily, rattled
into Edmonton, and the wild free life of the
last twenty months was over.</p>

<p>The excitement that the arrival of a stranger
never fails to create at a lonely Northern fort
is rather apt to give that stranger an exaggerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
idea of his own importance; but when I reached
Edmonton I at once realised that there are many
people in the world who have ideas beyond musk-ox
and caribou, dog-sleighs and snow-shoes. An
election was at its height to decide who should
have the honour of representing the territory of
Alberta at Ottawa. Edmonton had been drinking,
although it is supposed to keep strictly to
the rules of the Prohibition Act, and before I
had been an hour in the town I found myself
in the midst of a free fight. I was unfortunate
in not knowing the names of the candidates, or
what policy they represented, and as I could give
no clear account as to what I had done with my
vote, I was roughly used by both sides and was
glad to escape to the less boisterous hospitality
of the Hudson's Bay Fort.</p>

<p>There were still two hundred miles of snow-covered
prairie to be crossed to reach Calgary,
but with horses to drag our sleigh, and a house
to sleep in every night, there could be little hardship
in the journey. At the crossing of the Red
Deer we saw the iron rails that had already
pushed far out towards Edmonton, but work had
ceased for the winter and no trains were running.
As we travelled south the snow became
less every day, till we were forced to change our
runners for wheels when still sixty miles from
Calgary. Late in the evening of March 15th
the whistle of a locomotive told me, more plainly
than anything I had yet heard, that it was time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
to pull myself together and take up the common-place
life of civilization; a few more miles of
level country, down a steep pitch or two, across
the frozen stream of the Elbow, and close ahead
the lights of Calgary were blinking over the
prairie.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</a><span class="caption"><br />Edmonton</span>
</div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I am writing these concluding lines in a fashionable
garret off St. James's Street. Close at
hand are all the luxuries that only ultra-civilization
can give, and these luxuries are to be obtained
by the simple method of handing over
an adequate number of coins of the realm; there
is no necessity to shoulder your gun and tramp
many weary miles on snow-shoes before you get
even a sight of your dinner in its raw state. But
surely we carry this civilization too far, and are
in danger of warping our natural instincts by
too close observance of the rules that some mysterious
force obliges us to follow when we herd
together in big cities. Very emblematical of this
warping process are the shiny black boots into
which we squeeze our feet when we throw away
the moccasin of freedom; as they gall and pinch
the unaccustomed foot, so does the dread of our
friends' opinion gall and pinch our minds till
they become narrow, out of shape, and unable
to discriminate between reality and semblance.
A dweller in cities is too wrapped up in the
works of man to have much respect left for the
works of God, and to him the loneliness of forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
and mountain, lake and river, must ever appear
but a weary desolation. But there are many
sportsmen who love to be alone with Nature and
the animals far from their fellow-men, and as
this book is intended solely for the sportsman,
a few words of advice to anyone who is anxious
to hunt the musk-ox may not be out of place.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure that Fort Resolution is
the best point to start from. Fort Rae, on the
north arm of the Great Slave Lake, lies nearer
the Barren Ground, and the Dog-Ribs are said
to be more amenable to reason than the Yellow
Knives, while the distance to travel through a
woodless country is shorter. Fort Good Hope,
on the Lower Mackenzie, would be another good
spot to make headquarters; but there is less certainty
of finding the caribou in that neighbourhood,
and without the caribou there is little
chance of reaching the musk-ox. It is not the
slightest use starting from a post with the theory
that musk-ox can be killed in so many days, and
that, by taking a load of provisions sufficient to
last for the same length of time, a successful
hunt will be made. The only plan is to work
your way up slowly, to stay among the caribou
in the autumn, and kill and <i>cache</i> meat whenever
an opportunity offers, ready for a rush on
the first snow. Remember, too, when provisions
get scarce, as they certainly will at some time
or other, the country ahead is as big as the
country behind, and the best chance lies in pushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
on. To turn back may prove fatal, when
another day's travel may put you in a land of
plenty. It is possible to reach the hunting-ground
and return to Fort Resolution with a
canoe in the summer, but the robes are then
worthless, and the whole sport savours too much
of covert-shooting in July. Make quite sure
before you start that you are determined to push
on through everything, as even the Great Slave
Lake is far to go on an unsuccessful errand.
Here, in London, in front of a good fire at
the club and under the influence of a good dinner,
it is easy enough to kill musk-ox and make
long night-marches on snow-shoes by the flashes
of the Northern Lights; but the test of practice
takes off some of the enjoyment.</p>

<p>A year has slipped away since our winter
journey through the Peace River Pass. Young
Brick kept his promise of getting the <i>cache</i>
right well, and a couple of months ago my journals
arrived in England, so that I have been
able to put together this rough record of my
Northern travels. On looking back one remembers
only the good times, when meat was plentiful
and a huge fire lit up the snow on the spruce
trees; misery and starvation are forgotten as
soon as they are over, and even now, in the midst
of the luxury of civilization, at times I have
a longing to pitch my lodge once more at the
edge of the Barren Ground, to see the musk-ox
standing on the snowdrift and the fat caribou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
falling to the crack of the rifle, to hear the
ptarmigan crowing among the little pines as the
sun goes down over a frozen lake and the glory
of an Arctic night commences.</p>

<p>To the man who is not a lover of Nature in
all her moods the Barren Ground must always
be a howling, desolate wilderness; but for my
part, I can understand the feeling that prompted
Saltatha's answer to the worthy priest, who was
explaining to him the beauties of Heaven. "My
father, you have spoken well; you have told me
that Heaven is very beautiful; tell me now one
thing more. Is it more beautiful than the country
of the musk-ox in summer, when sometimes
the mist blows over the lakes, and sometimes
the water is blue, and the loons cry very often?
That is beautiful; and if Heaven is still more
beautiful, my heart will be glad, and I shall
be content to rest there till I am very old."</p>

<h2>APPENDIX I</h2>


<p>I am much indebted to Professor Dawson, of the
Dominion Geological Survey Department, for his
kind permission to publish the following paper on
the Unexplored Regions of Canada. It shows more
plainly than any words of mine could tell how much
yet remains to be done before this great portion of
the British Empire is known as it ought to be.</p>


<h3>ON SOME OF THE LARGER UNEXPLORED
REGIONS OF CANADA.</h3>

<div class="center">(By <span class="smcap">G. M. Dawson</span>, D.S., Assoc. R.S.M., F.G.S.,
F.R.S.C.)</div>

<p>If on reading the title of the paper which I had
promised to contribute to the Ottawa Field Naturalists'
Club, any one should have supposed it to be
my intention to endeavour to describe or forecast
the character of the unexplored areas mentioned, I
must, in the first place, disclaim any such intention.
The very existence of large regions of which little
or nothing is known, is of course stimulating to a
fertile imagination, ready to picture to itself undiscovered
"golden cities a thousand leagues deep in
Cathay," but such unscientific use of the imagination
is far removed from the position of sober seriousness,
in which I ask your attention to the facts which
I have to present.</p>

<p>Fortunately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span> or unfortunately, as we may happen
to regard it, the tendency of our time is all in the
direction of laying bare to inspection and open to
exploitation all parts, however remote, of this comparatively
small world in which we live, and though
the explorer himself may be impelled by a certain
romanticism in overcoming difficulties or even dangers
met with in the execution of his task, his steps
are surely and closely followed by the trader, the
lumberer, or the agriculturalist, and not long after
these comes the builder of railways with his iron
road. It is, therefore, rather from the point of view
of practical utility than from any other, that an
appeal must be made to the public or to the Government
for the further extension of explorations, and
my main purpose in addressing you to-night is to
make such an appeal, and to show cause, if possible,
for the exploration of such considerable portions of
Canada as still remain almost or altogether unmapped.</p>

<p>What I have to say, in fact, on this subject resolves
itself chiefly into remarks on the map exhibited
here, upon which the unexplored areas to
which I am about to refer are clearly depicted in
such a manner, I believe, as almost to speak for
themselves.</p>

<p>It is very commonly supposed, even in Canada,
but to a greater extent elsewhere, that all parts of
the Dominion are now so well known that exploration,
in the true sense of the term, may be considered
as a thing of the past. This depends largely
upon the fact that the maps of the country generally
examined are upon a very small scale, and that upon
such maps no vast areas yet remain upon which rivers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
lakes, mountains, or other features are not depicted.
If, however, we take the trouble to enquire
more closely into this, and consult perhaps one of
the geographers whose maps we have examined,
asking such awkward questions as may occur to us
on the sources of information for this region or
that, we may probably by him be referred to another
and older map, and so on till we find in the end
that the whole topographical fabric of large parts
of all these maps rests upon information of the
vaguest kind.</p>

<p>Of most of the large areas marked upon the map
here shown, this is absolutely true, and the interests
of knowledge with respect to these would be
better subserved if such areas were left entirely
blank, or, at least, if all the geographical features
drawn upon them appeared in broken lines, in such
a way as to show that none of them are certain. In
other regions, the main geographical outlines, such
as the courses of the larger rivers, are indicated
approximately, with such accuracy as may be possible
from accounts or itineraries derived from travellers
or from officers of the Hudson's Bay Company;
or from the descriptions or rough sketches of
Indians or other persons by whom the region has
been traversed, but who have been unprovided with
instruments of any kind and whose knowledge of
the country has been incidentally obtained.</p>

<p>There is, in the case of such partially explored
regions, more excuse for the delineation of the main
features on our maps, as these may be useful in
imparting general information of a more or less inexact
kind. We can scarcely, however, admit that
such regions have been explored in any true sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
of that term, while they are certainly unsurveyed,
and very little confidence can be placed in maps of
this kind as guides in travel. When, ten years ago,
I struck across from Fort Macleod, on the west
side of the Rocky Mountains, with the purpose of
reaching Fort Dunvegan on the Peace, through a
country densely forested and without trails or
tracks of any kind, I had so much confidence in the
existing maps of that region as to assume that Dunvegan
was at least approximately correct in position
on them. As often as possible I took observations
for latitude, and each night worked out our
position by latitude and departure, till at a certain
point I was about to turn off to the north of the line
previously followed with the confident anticipation
of finding Dunvegan. Just here, very fortunately,
we fell in with some Indians, and though our means
of communicating with them were very imperfect,
we gathered enough to lead us to accept the guidance
of one of them, who promised to lead us to the fort,
but took an entirely different direction from that I
had proposed taking. He was right, but Dunvegan
proved to be, as shown on the maps, nearly forty
miles west of its real position. Fortunately no very
great importance attached to our reaching Dunvegan
on a given day, but none the less, this practical
experience proved to me very conclusively the desirability
of showing features in broken lines, or
otherwise indicating their uncertainty when they
have not been properly fixed.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, however, that most of the
travellers ordinarily to be found in these unexplored
regions, being Indians or hunters, traders and others
travelling under the guidance of Indians, do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
depend on the latitudes and longitudes of places, or
on the respective bearings of one place from another.
The Indians follow routes with which they
have been familiar since childhood, or, when beyond
the boundaries of their own particular region
of country, go by landmarks, such as mountains,
lakes, and rivers, which have been described to them
by their neighbours. Their memory in this respect
is remarkable; but it must be remembered that
among their principal subjects of conversation when
sitting about the camp-fire are the distances in day's
journeys from place to place, the routes which they
have followed or have known others to follow, the
difficulties to be encountered on these, the points at
which food of different kinds may be obtained, and
the features which strike them as being remarkable
in the country traversed. Returning, however, from
this digression, which began with the statement that
accurate maps of such regions as are at present
merely traversed by traders and Indians, are not
imperative from the point of view of such travellers,
it may with confidence be affirmed that such
maps and explorations upon which they are based
are absolutely essential to civilized society, to show
in the first place what the natural resources of these
regions are and how they may be utilized, in the
second by what highways such regions may be most
easily reached.</p>

<p>A glance at the map will show, that while many
of the larger unexplored areas may be affirmed to
lie to the north of the limit of profitable agriculture,
considerable regions situated to the south of this
limit still await examination. Large districts, again,
in which no farmer will ever voluntarily settle, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
afford timber which the world will be glad to get
when the white pine of our nearer forests shall become
more nearly exhausted, while, with respect to
mineral resources, it is probable that in the grand
aggregate the value of those which exist in the unexplored
regions will be found, area for area, to be
equal to those of the known regions, comparing each
particular geological formation with its nearest representative.
On the grounds alone, therefore, of
geographical knowledge, and of the discovery and
definition of the reserves of the country in timber
and minerals, the exploration of all these unknown
or little-known regions may be amply justified.</p>

<p>Taking a line drawn north and south in the longitude
of the Red River Valley, which is, as nearly
as may be, the centre of Canada from east to west,
it may confidently be stated that by far the larger
part of the country in which agricultural settlement
is possible lies to the west, while the great bulk of
the actual population lies to the east of this line.
Looking to this grand fundamental fact, I believe
it may safely be affirmed that some members of this
audience will live to see the day when these conditions
with respect to population will be boldly reversed,
and in which the greater number of our representatives
in Parliament gathering here will come
from this great western region.</p>

<p>This disposition of the cultivable land depends
partly upon the physical characteristics of the country,
and in part on its climatic conditions. Beyond
Winnipeg, and stretching therefrom to the west and
north-west, is the great area of prairie, plain, and
plateau, which, wider near the forty-ninth parallel
than elsewhere on the continent, runs on in one form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
or other, though with diminishing width, to the
Arctic Ocean. This is, generally speaking, an alluvial
region, and one of fertile soils. Very fortunately,
and as though by a beneficent provision of
nature, the climatic features favour the utilization
of this belt. The summer isothermals, which carry
with them the possibility of ripening crops, trend
far to the north.</p>

<p>Let us trace, for example, and as a rough and
ready index of the northern limit of practicable
agriculture of any kind, that isothermal line which
represents a mean temperature of 60° Fahrenheit
in the month of July. Passing through the southern
part of Newfoundland and touching the island
of Anticosti, this line runs to the north end of Mistassini
Lake, and thence crosses Hudson's Bay,
striking the west shore a short distance north of
York Factory. Thence it runs westward, skirting
the north end of Reindeer Lake, and then bending
to the north-west, crosses Great Slave Lake, and
touches the southern extremity of Great Bear Lake.
From this point it resumes a westward course and
crosses the Yukon River a considerable distance to
the north of the confluence of the Pelly and the
Lewes, turning south again almost on the east line
of Alaska. We need not, however, further follow
its course, as owing to peculiar climatic conditions
on the West Coast, it ceases there to be any criterion
as to the conditions of agriculture.</p>

<p>The character of much of the western interior
country is such that its exploration and survey is
comparatively easy, and it will be observed that
here the larger unknown regions are to be found
only far to the northward, leaving in the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
rugged and inhospitable eastern region vast islands
of unexplored country in much more southern latitudes.</p>

<p>It may be said, in fact, that comparatively little
of the region capable, so far as climate goes, of
producing wheat is now altogether unknown; but
it may be added, that increasing as the world now
is in population, its people cannot much longer expect
to find wheat-growing lands unoccupied in
large blocks. The time is within measurable distance
when lands with a fertile soil though more or
less rigorous climate, in which only barley, oats,
hemp, flax, and other hardy crops can be matured,
will be in demand, and we are far from having
acquired even a good general knowledge of these
lands in Canada.</p>

<p>For many of the unexplored regions marked upon
this map, however, we can in reason appeal only
to their possible or presumable mineral wealth as
an incentive to their exploration, and if some of
them should prove wholly or in great part barren
when such exploration shall have been carried out,
it will not be without utility to acquire even this
negative information, and write upon them in characters
as large as need be, "No thoroughfare."</p>

<p>I will now ask your further attention for a few
moments while I run over and make some remarks
in detail on the various unexplored areas as indicated
on the map. It must first, however, be explained
in what manner the unexplored areas referred
to have been outlined. All lines, such as
those of rivers, chains of lakes, or other travelled
routes, along which reasonably satisfactory explorations
have been made and of which fairly accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
route-maps are in existence, are given an approximate
average width of about fifty miles, or twenty-five
miles on each side of the explorer's or surveyor's
track. The known lines are thus arbitrarily
assumed to be wide belts of explored country, and
that which is referred to as unexplored comprises
merely the intervening tracts. By this mode of
definition the unexplored regions are reduced to
minimum dimensions. Neither are any comparatively
small tracts of country lying between explored
routes included in my enumeration, in which the
least area mentioned is one of 7500 square miles;
nor are the Arctic islands, lying to the north of
the continent, referred to. Because of the empirical
mode in which the unexplored areas have thus
been delineated, it has not been attempted to estimate
with more than approximate accuracy the number
of square miles contained in each, my purpose
being merely to render apparent the great dimensions
of these areas.</p>

<p>In enumerating these areas, I shall not refer to
the various explorations and lines of survey by
which they are defined and separated one from another,
as this would involve mention of nearly all
the explorers who have traversed the northern part
of the continent. I shall, however, note such excursions
as have been made into or across the regions
which are characterized as unexplored.</p>

<p>Beginning, then, in the extreme north-west of the
Dominion, we find these areas to be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Area between the eastern boundary of Alaska,
the Porcupine River and the Arctic Coast, 9500
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>square miles, or somewhat smaller than Belgium.
This area lies entirely within the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>2. Area west of the Lewes and Yukon Rivers and
extending to the boundary of Alaska, 32,000 square
miles, or somewhat larger than Ireland. This country
includes the head-waters of the White and
probably of the Tanana Rivers, and, being comparatively
low and sheltered from the sea by one
of the highest mountain-ranges on the continent, the
St. Elias Alps, doubtless possesses some remarkable
peculiarities of climate.</p>

<p>3. Area between the Lewes, Pelly, and Stikine
Rivers and to the east of the Coast Ranges, 27,000
square miles, or nearly as large as Scotland. This
has been penetrated only by a few "prospectors,"
from whom, and from Indians, the courses of rivers
shown on my maps published in connection with
the Yukon Expedition Report are derived. It lies
on the direct line of the metalliferous belt of the
Cordillera, and its low lands are capable of producing
hardy crops.</p>

<p>4. Area between the Pelly and Mackenzie Rivers,
100,000 square miles, or about twice the size of
England. This belongs partly to the Yukon Basin
and partly to that of the Mackenzie, and includes
nearly 600 miles in length of the main Rocky Mountain
Range. Many years ago, Mr. A. K. Isbister
penetrated the northern part of this area for some
distance on the line of the Peel River,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but owing
to the manner in which he had to travel, but little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>accuracy can be attributed to his sketch of that river.
Abbé Petitot also made a short journey into its
northern part from the Mackenzie River side, but,
with these exceptions, no published information exists
respecting it.</p>

<p>5. Area between Great Bear Lake and the Arctic
Coast, 50,000 square miles, or about equal to England
in size. Nearly all to the north of the Arctic
Circle.</p>

<p>6. Area between Great Bear Lake, the Mackenzie,
and the western part of Great Slave Lake, 35,000
square miles, or larger than Portugal. With respect
to this region and that last mentioned, it must be
explained that I have felt some doubt whether they
should be characterised as unexplored on the basis
previously explained as that which is generally applied.
Between 1857 and 1865, Mr. R. Macfarlane,
of the Hudson's Bay Company, carried out an intelligent
and valuable examination of part of the
region north of Great Bear Lake, some results of
which have lately been published,<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and in both of
these areas, between 1864 and 1871, the indefatigable
missionary, Abbé Petitot, made numerous journeys,
of which he subsequently published an account.<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
As Petitot's instruments consisted merely
of a compass, and a watch which he rated by the
meridian passage of the sun, it must be assumed that
his mapping of the country does not possess any
great accuracy. His work, however, considering the
difficulties under which it was performed, is deserving
of all praise, and his several descriptions of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>character of the country traversed are most valuable.
It does not appear from his account of these
regions that they are likely to prove of great utility
to civilized man, except as fur-preserves, or possibly
from the minerals which they may contain. He
writes: "Ce pays est composé de contrées silencieuses
comme le tombeau, des plaines vastes comme
des départements, des steppes glacés plus affreux que
ceux de la Sibérie, de forêts chétives, rabougries
comme on n'en voit que dans le voisinage des glaciers
du Nord."</p>

<p>7. Area between Stikine and Liard Rivers to the
north and Skeena and Peace Rivers to the south,
81,000 square miles, or more than twice as large
as Newfoundland. This includes a portion of the
western Cordillera, and, between the Liard and
Peace Rivers, a large tract of the interior plateau
region of the continent, parts of which, there is reason
to believe, consist of good agricultural land.
Its western extremity was crossed in 1866 and 1867
by the exploratory survey of the Western Union
or Collins' Telegraph Company, then engaged in an
attempt to connect the North American and European
telegraph systems through Asia. No details of
this part of their exploration have, however, been
published, and if we may judge from other parts
of their line, since checked, the survey made was
of too rough a character to possess much geographical
value.</p>

<p>8. Area between Peace, Athabasca, and Loon
Rivers, 7500 square miles, or about half as large as
Switzerland.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>
<p>9. Area south-east of Athabasca Lake, 35,000
square miles. This may be compared in extent to
Portugal.</p>

<p>10. Area east of the Coppermine River and west
of Bathurst Inlet, 7,500 square miles. This again
may be compared to half the area of Switzerland.</p>

<p>11. Area between the Arctic Coast and Back's
River, 31,000 square miles, or about equal to Ireland.</p>

<p>12. Area surrounded by Back's River, Great
Slave Lake, Athabasca Lake, Hatchet and Reindeer
Lakes, Churchill River, and the west coast of
Hudson's Bay, 178,000 square miles. Much larger
than Great Britain and Ireland, and somewhat larger
than Sweden. The lakes and rivers shown in
this great region depend entirely on the result of the
three journeys made by Hearne in 1769-1772.<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Hearne really wandered through parts of this region
in company with Indians whom he was unable
to control, his ultimate object (which he at
length accomplished) being to reach the Coppermine
River, in order to ascertain for the Hudson's
Bay Company whether it was possible to utilize the
native copper found there. Not even roughly approximate
accuracy can be assigned to his geographical
work. Referring to the position of the mouth
of the Coppermine, he writes:&mdash;"The latitude may
be depended upon to within 20 miles at the utmost."
In reality it afterwards proved to be 200 miles too
far north. This country includes the great "barren
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>grounds" of the continent, and is the principal winter
resort of the musk-ox as well as of great herds
of caribou. Hearne's general characterization of it
is not very encouraging, but certainly we shall know
more about it. He writes:&mdash;"The land throughout
the whole tract of country is scarcely anything but
one solid mass of rocks and stones, and in most
parts very hilly, particularly to the westward,
among the woods." The north-eastern extremity
of this region was also crossed by Lieut. Schwatka
in the course of his remarkable journey to King-William
Land, but his geographical results possess
little value.<a name="FNanchor_2_5" id="FNanchor_2_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>13. Area between Severn and Attawapishkat Rivers
and the coast of Hudson's Bay, 22,000 square
miles, or larger than Nova Scotia. Several lakes
and rivers are shown upon the maps in this region
in practically identical form since Arrowsmith's
map of 1850, but I have been unable to ascertain
the origin of the information.</p>

<p>14. Area between Trout Lake, Lac Seul, and the
Albany River, 15,000 square miles, or about half
the size of Scotland.</p>

<p>15. Area to the south and east of James Bay,
35,000 square miles, which also may be compared
to the area of Portugal. This region is the nearest
of those which still remain unexplored to large centres
of population. It is probable that much of it
consists of low land which may afford merchantable
timber.</p>

<p>16. Area comprising almost the entire interior of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
the Labrador peninsula or North-east Territory,
289,000 square miles. This is more than equal to
twice the area of Great Britain and Ireland, with
an added area equal to that of Newfoundland. Several
lines of exploration and survey have been carried
for a certain distance into the interior of this
great peninsula, among which may be mentioned
those of Professor Hind, Mr. A. P. Low, and Mr.
R. F. Holme.<a name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The limits of the unexplored area
have been drawn so as to exclude all these. The
area regarded as still unexplored has, however, it
is true, been traversed in several directions at different
times by officers of the Hudson's Bay Company,
particularly on routes leading from the vicinity
of Mingan on the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the
head of Hamilton Inlet, and thence to Ungava Bay.
These routes have also, according to Mr. Holme,
been travelled by a missionary, Père Lacasse; but
the only published information which I have been
able to find is contained in a book written by J.
McLean,<a name="FNanchor_2_7" id="FNanchor_2_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and in a brief account of a journey by
Rev. E. J. Peck.<a name="FNanchor_3_8" id="FNanchor_3_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Mr. McLean made several journeys
and established trading-posts between Ungava
and Hamilton Inlet in the years 1838-1841, while
Mr. Peck crossed from Little Whale River, on Hudson
Bay, to Ungava in 1884. Something may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>gathered as to the general nature of the country
along certain lines from the accounts given by these
gentlemen, but there is little of a really satisfactory
character, while neither has made any attempt to
fix positions or delineate the features of the region
on the map. In all probability this entire region
consists of a rocky plateau or hilly tract of rounded
archæan rocks, highest on the north-east side and
to the south, and sloping gradually down to low
land towards Ungava Bay. It is known to be more
or less wooded, and in some places with timber
of fair growth; but if it should be possessed of any
real value, this may probably lie in its metalliferous
deposits. In this tract of country particularly there
is reason to hope that ores like those of Tilt Cove,
in Newfoundland, or those of Sudbury, in Ontario,
may occur.</p>

<p>To sum up briefly, in conclusion, what has been
said as to the larger unexplored areas of Canada,
it may be stated that, while the entire area of the
Dominion as computed at 3,470,257 square miles,
about 954,000 square miles of the continent alone,
exclusive of the inhospitable detached Arctic portions,
is for all practical purposes entirely unknown.
In this estimate the area of the unexplored country
is reduced to a minimum by the mode of definition
employed. Probably we should be much nearer
the mark in assuming it as about one million square
miles, or between one-third and one-fourth of the
whole. Till this great aggregate of unknown territory
shall have been subjected to examination,
or at least till it has been broken up and traversed
in many directions by exploratory and survey lines,
we must all feel that it stands as a certain reproach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>to our want of enterprise and of a justifiable curiosity.
In order, however, to properly ascertain and
make known the natural resources of the great
tracts lying beyond the borders of civilization, such
explorations and surveys as are undertaken must
be of a truly scientific character. The explorer or
surveyor must possess some knowledge of geology
and botany, as well as such scientific training as may
enable him to make intelligent and accurate observations
of any natural features or phenomena with
which he may come in contact. He must not consider
that his duty consists merely in the perfunctory
measuring of lines and the delineation of rivers,
lakes, and mountains. An explorer or surveyor
properly equipped for his work need never return
empty-handed. Should he be obliged to report that
some particular district possesses no economic value
whatever, besides that of serving as a receiver of
rain and a reservoir to feed certain river-systems,
his notes should contain scientific observations on
geology, botany, climatology, and similar subjects,
which may alone be sufficient to justify the expenditure
incurred.</p>

THE PURPLE LAND<br />
INTRODUCED BY<br />
THEODORE ROOSEVELT<br />
</div>

<p>James M. Barrie says: "It is one of the choicest things of
our latter day literature."</p>

<p>Galsworthy says: "Hudson in that romantic piece of
realism, 'The Purple Land,' has a supreme gift of disclosing
not only the thing he sees, but the spirit of his vision. Without
apparent effort he takes you with him into a rare, free,
natural world, and always you are refreshed, stimulated, enlarged,
by going there. A very great writer, and&mdash;to my
thinking&mdash;the most valuable our Age possesses."</p>

A SHEPHERD'S LIFE<br />
</div>

<p>In "A Shepherd's Life" Hudson takes us into a quaint
old-fashioned world, that of the shepherds of the bleak South
Downs of England, where in sheltered folds of the naked
plains nestle placid little old-world villages, shaded by immemorial
trees and surrounded by quiet, forgotten streams.</p>

<h2>BOOKS <i>by</i> BOYD CABLE</h2>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>The books by this young artillery officer have probably
given the English speaking world a better understanding
of the intimate details of the Great War than
anything else that has been written. Cast for the most
part in the form of fiction, and written for the most
part within sound of the German guns, they have an
atmosphere of reality that no mere work of the imagination
can possess.</p>


<p>BETWEEN THE LINES</p>
<div class="right"><i>Net $1.50</i>

that lies <i>between the lines</i> of the cold and formal official
despatch.</p>

<p>These are the words that swing the muzzles of the
advancing guns towards the enemy. More stories that
give you a respect for Thomas Atkins that borders on
affection.</p>

<p>DOING THEIR BIT</p>

<p>A vivid description of the way the munition workers

<p>Twenty-four hours of a "big push." What it feels
like to be a private soldier for just one day of a modern
battle. As heart lifting as the <i>Battle Hymn of the Republic</i>
from which the title is taken.</p>

<h2><i>A</i><br />
Student in Arms</h2>

<div class="center">
BY<br />
DONALD HANKEY<br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Published originally in the columns of
the London <i>Spectator</i>, these short articles,
sketches, and essays, written by a man in
the trenches, form a "war-book" of quite
unusual kind, dealing with the deeper
things of human life.</p>

<p>The high spiritual idealism which actuates
so many thousands in the ranks of
the Allies finds a voice in it, and the mental
attitude of the fighting-men towards
religion, the Church, their officers and their
comrades, is exhibited not only with sanity
and sympathy, but with a fine simplicity
of language and an inspiring nobility
of outlook.</p>

<h3>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or

<p>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
